Tonight's @risc_v Tip:

The `Zmmul` extension species only the multiplication instructions from the `M` extension, allowing constrained RISC-V implementations to opt not to support division. The spec calls out FPGAs as an example, as many have built-in multiplier hardware.

You'll notice that `MULW` is only supported on RV64 implementations. This instruction multiplies the lower 32 bits (i.e. "Multiply Word") of `rs1` and `rs2` and places the sign-extension of the lower 32 bits of the result in `rd`.
