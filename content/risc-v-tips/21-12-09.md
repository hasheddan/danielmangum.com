Tonight's @risc_v Tip:

RISC-V contains a few interrupt controller specs, each providing additional functionality over basic privilege-based preemption:

- Core-Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC)
- Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC)
- Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA)

The Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) spec encompasses two different interrupt controllers:

- Advanced Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (APLIC)
- Incoming Message-Signaled Interrupt Controller (IMSIC)
