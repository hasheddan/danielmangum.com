Ever wondered how to open a UDP socket in [@risc_v](https://twitter.com/risc_v)
assembly? Wonder no more!

```assembly

li    a0, 2
li    a1, 2
li    a2, 0
li    a7, 198
ecall

```

Let's walk through it! üëáüèºüßµ

---

The first thing to understand is that we are just a "normal" program running in
user space. We don't have special privileges in the system, and opening a socket
is a privileged operation. In order to accomplish this, we'll need to "ask" the
kernel to do something on our behalf.

---

Programs in user space can talk to the kernel via system calls.
[@risc_v](https://twitter.com/risc_v) provides the `ecall` instruction to
communicate from a lower privilege level to a higher one. In this case, we are
communicating from "user mode" to "supervisor mode". Read more
[here](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-privilege-levels/).

---

Issuing an `ecall` instruction causes a ["precise
trap"](https://danielmangum.com/risc-v-tips/2021-12-22-trap-precision/). The
kernel registers "trap handlers" to respond to different events that cause
traps. In this case, we need to tell the kernel what we need it to do for us.

---

The kernel supports different
[syscall](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html) "calling
conventions" for different architectures. These can be found in the Linux man
pages, but here is a summary:

![22-05-14_1](../../static/risc-v-tips/22-05-14_1.png)

---

We can see for [@risc_v](https://twitter.com/risc_v) that the system call
(syscall) number needs to be present in argument register 7 (`a7`). Walking
backwards up our sequence of instructions, you can see we are using the [load
immediate
pseudo-instruction](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md#load-immediate)
(`li`) to load `198` into `a7`.

---

So how do we know to use `198`? We need to look in the kernel! Syscall numbers
are defined in various locations for different architectures; for
[@risc_v](https://twitter.com/risc_v) we can follow include directives from
`unistd.h`:

- [`arch/riscv/include/asm/unistd.h`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/riscv/include/asm/unistd.h)
- [`arch/riscv/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/riscv/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h)
- [`include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/a19944809fe9942e6a96292490717904d0690c21/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h#L588)

---

If you don't want to look in kernel source to find the syscall number for a
given architecture, you can use this wonderful page from
[@haerwu](https://twitter.com/haerwu) that lists syscall numbers for all
architectures:
[link](https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/download/tables/syscalls.html).

---

Okay, now that we know that 198 corresponds to the `socket` syscall, we need to
determine what arguments it requires to inform the type of socket (UDP) we want
to open. Back to the [man
pages](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html) we go!

![22-05-14_2](../../static/risc-v-tips/22-05-14_2.png)

---

So we need to provide `domain`, `type`, and `protocol`. Luckily the man page
also defines the options available to us, but we need to map those to the
correct integer values. Specifically we want:
- Domain: `AF_INET`
- Type: `SOCK_DGRAM`
- Protocol: `0` (default)

![22-05-14_3](../../static/risc-v-tips/22-05-14_3.png)

---

`AF_INET` and `SOCK_DGRAM` are both defined in `socket.h` in glibc:
- [`AF_INET`](https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/d275970ab56f8ba6a3ca598aba75db4daabe5924/bits/socket.h#L111)
- [`SOCK_DGRAM`](https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/d275970ab56f8ba6a3ca598aba75db4daabe5924/bits/socket.h#L45)

Conveniently, both are defined with the integer `2`.

---

Issuing a syscall is not so different from calling a function in your program as
it requires passing arguments according to a calling convention. We follow the
[@risc_v](https://twitter.com/risc_v) [psABI calling
convention](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc)
and pass our arguments in the `a0`, `a1`, and `a2` registers.

---

Lastly, we need to issue our `ecall` command. This will cause the hart to jump
to the address defined in the [Supervisor Trap Vector
register](https://danielmangum.com/risc-v-tips/2021-12-01-supervisor-trap-base-address/)
(`stvec`), which is where the kernel has placed the logic to handle different
types of traps.

---

The kernel will handle our request and return either the file descriptor for the
socket, or -1 indicating a failed operation. That's all for today though! If
folks enjoy threads like this, I'll continue posting as I work on my
[@risc_v](https://twitter.com/risc_v) assembly implementation of
[@quicwg](https://twitter.com/quicwg) :)
