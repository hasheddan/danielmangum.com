Today's @risc_v Tip:

RISC-V defines its memory model (RVWMO) in the context of 3 orderings:
- Program Order: order of ops performed by a single hart
- Global Memory Order: order of ops performed by all harts
- Preserved Program Order: subset of program order respected globally

This diagram is an abstract example, but the key points are illustrated: memory operations appear to perform sequentially in the context of a single hart, but may not be observed in the same order globally. RVWMO defines which operations in a program order are respected globally.

RVWMO is specified by a series of preserved program order rules in the following categories:
- Overlapping-Address Orderings
- Explicit Synchronization
- Syntactic Dependencies
- Pipeline Dependencies

And memory model axioms:
- Load Value Axiom
- Atomicity Axiom
- Progress Axiom
