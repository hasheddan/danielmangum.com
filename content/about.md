+++

My name is Daniel Mangum and I am the Chief Technology Officer at
[Golioth](https://golioth.io/), where I lead engineering efforts that span
hardware, firmware, and cloud software. Previously, I was a principal software
engineer at [Upbound](https://www.upbound.io/) where I helped build [Upbound
Cloud](https://cloud.upbound.io), [Upbound
Marketplace](https://marketplace.upbound.io), and the open source
[Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) project. Prior to Upbound, I worked as a
counsultant on large-scale cloud deployments at Fortune 500 companies.

I have participated in multiple open source communities, including holding
leadership positions in the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) project. I am
equally passionate about hardware and software, and often find myself at the
points where they intersect.
