Just a few minutes after arriving at [Hackaday Supercon
2023](https://hackaday.io/superconference/), I decided that I needed to document
my experience. Working with [two](https://chaos.social/@szczys)
[longtime](https://chaos.social/@chris_gammell) Supercon veterans (they
literally started the thing!), I had been adequately prepared for experiencing
the event for the first time, but there is nothing quite like actually being
there in-person. Even at 9 AM on Friday, the energy and activity was already
bubbling. Despite not knowing many folks, or only knowing of them by their
online presence, I felt as though I was attending a gathering of old friends.

After waiting in a short line to check-in, we were given our conference bag, and
most importantly, our
[badge](https://hackaday.com/2023/10/18/2023-hackaday-supercon-badge-welcome-to-the-vectorscope/).
The badge this year, named the
[Vectorscope](https://github.com/Hack-a-Day/Vectorscope), is based on the
[Raspberry Pi
Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html),
a board featuring the [RP2040
microcontroller](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/rp2040.html).
The announcement post contained enough information for us to get started with
some "pre-hacking" a few weeks ago (see post
[here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielmangum_ill-be-at-hackaday-supercon-this-year-and-activity-7123370919787466753-yzsL)),
but actually having the badge in-hand allowed us to examine some of the finer
details. The venue was full of rows of tables with power strips and soldering
irons, and I settled in at one of them amidst a group of other folks who were
already hard at work modifying the badge's firmware and hardware. There was a
talk at 11 AM detailing the badge's architecture and behavior, but expectedly,
no one was going to wait for that.

The first step to getting the badge working was to connect the [signal
generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_generator) pins to the
[scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope) pins via provided jumper
wires. This loopback allowed for the pre-programmed [Lissajous
curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve) to dance on the small
display.

Naturally, I was eager to play with the firmware and see what was possible.
Nearly all of it was written in [Micropython](https://micropython.org/), and the
source was available on the microcontroller itself. While use of the [Thonny
IDE](https://thonny.org/) was encouraged, I wanted to stay within my
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) development environment, so I installed
[mpremote](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html).
After connecting the badge to my development machine over USB, I was immediately
able to check out the filesystem.

```

I could then easily open any of the files in Neovim on my machine by setting it
as `$EDITOR`.

```
$ EDITOR=nvim mpremote edit pixel_pusher.py
```

This meant that I had language server support (I use
[`ruff-lsp`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp) for Python), as well as all
of my other Neovim shortcuts. Other than the Lissajous curves, there was also a
demo that displayed a slideshow of planets on the display. Wanting to show off
the new [Golioth](https://golioth.io/) logo on my badge, I downloaded a PNG, and
resized it / converted to JPEG using
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php).

```
$ convert golioth.png -resize 240x240 golioth.jpg
```

From there, I copied the image over to the filesystem on the badge, then updated
the slideshow images array with its path.

```
$ mpremote golioth.jpg :golioth.jpg
```

```
$ EDITOR=nvim mpremote edit planets.py
```

```python
# comamnds for slides
TEXT=0
IMAGE=1
BACKGROUND=2
TEXTXY=3

slides=[
        [ IMAGE, "golioth.jpg" ], # golioth logo
        [ IMAGE, "pl_mercury.jpg" ],
        [ IMAGE, "pl_venus.jpg" ],
        [ IMAGE, "pl_earth.jpg" ],
        [ IMAGE, "pl_moon.jpg" ],        
        [ IMAGE, "pl_mars.jpg" ],
        [ IMAGE, "pl_jupiter.jpg" ],
        [ IMAGE, "pl_saturn.jpg" ],
        [ IMAGE, "pl_uranus.jpg" ],
        [ IMAGE, "pl_neptune.jpg" ],
       ]
```

After doing so, I was able to display the logo on the screen, and I was ready to
dig into some more complex projects that we had plannned. I spent most of the
rest of the day just hacking and meeting new folks. The concentration of kind
and interesting people was off the charts, and I ended up talking to a lot of
folks who I had followed online for some time. We learned a ton while hacking on
the badge, but ultimately are attempting a fairly complex demo, so we'll see if
we are able to have it all working by the showcase on Sunday night. I'll include
detail of some of the issues we are running into in the next update.

![supercon-day-1-1](../../static/supercon_day_1_1.jpg)

It is Saturday morning and the talks start in earnest today. I fully anticipate
bouncing between high-quality presentations and my station at the badge hacking
tables. If you're at Supercon and want to meet, please feel free to come say hi
or reach out via one the social links on the [home
page](https://danielmangum.com/). See y'all tomorrow!
