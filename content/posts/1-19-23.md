Like most API servers, a, if not the, primary function of the Kubernetes API Server is to ingest data, store it, then return it when requested. Today we are going to be focusing on how the API Server stores data.

## The `apiserver` Module

For the first few posts in this series, we are going to be focusing on a single module in the Kubernetes code base. The [`apiserver` module](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver) is a self-described ["generic library for building a Kubernetes aggregated API server."](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver#apiserver) It includes a set of packages that provide generic[^1] functionality that you would expect for an API server: `audit`, `authentication`, `authorization`, and more. Some of these packages nest additional packages, following the familiar pattern of offering an interface, then one or more concrete implementations of the interface. One such example is the [`storage` package](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage).

## The `storage` Package

The `storage` package is, well, for storing data. Or if you want to be more formal about it, provides ["interfaces for database-related operations."](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/3154010eec3488dd64110e3ca6c4ba0b5ac61310/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/doc.go#L17) At the center of the aforementioned interfaces is [`storage.Interface`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/3154010eec3488dd64110e3ca6c4ba0b5ac61310/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/interfaces.go#L159), which "hides all the storage-related operations behind it." For being such a foundational component in the layers of the API Server, the interface is really quite straightforward, exposing only 8 methods, mostly for operations that would be expected for storage and retrieval. These methods include:

---

```go
Versioner() Versioner
```

`Versioner` is an accessor method that returns an implementation of the [`Versioner` interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/3154010eec3488dd64110e3ca6c4ba0b5ac61310/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/interfaces.go#L38), also provided by the `storage` package, used to abstract the versioning of resources when modified.

```go
Create(ctx context.Context, key string, obj, out runtime.Object, ttl uint64) error
```

`Create` is responsible for adding data in the form of a `runtime.Object` to the underlying storage implementation with the provided `key`. It supports setting a "time to live" (`ttl`) if the data for the `key` should be expired after some period, and allows for passing a separate `runtime.Object` (`out`) that should be used to represent the object's state after being prepared and stored.

```go
Delete(ctx context.Context, key string, out runtime.Object, preconditions *Preconditions, validateDeletion ValidateObjectFunc, cachedExistingObject runtime.Object) error
```

`Delete` is responsible for removing data at the given `key`, and returning the data in the form of a `runtime.Object`. It allows setting `preconditions` that must be met for the operation to be successful (object `UUID` and `ResourceVersion` may be supplied), as well as an object validation function (`validateDeletion`). The latter is a simple hook in the form of `func(ctx context.Context, obj runtime.Object) error` that should return an error if the resource is invalid. The last supplied argument, `cachedExistingObject`, can be used to optimize the deletion flow in the event that the state of the desired version of the object to be deleted is already known. As you may have already guessed, if the version of the cached object does not match the `ResourceVersion` in the `preconditions`, or we fail validation, it could be due to the cached object being stale, in which case we will need to fetch a fresh version before attempting again[^2].

```go
Watch(ctx context.Context, key string, opts ListOptions) (watch.Interface, error)
```

`Watch` returns a [`watch.Interface`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/7f8be71148f5461df9ae61b011c732d0ba2f551c/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/watch/watch.go#L29) that enables observing changes to the data at the provided `key` over a period of time. The `watch` interface is a simple, but powerful abstraction, supporting only two operations (`ResultChan() <-chan Event` and `Stop()`) that offer a high degree of leeway to the implementation. However, the `ListOptions`, which allow specifying the resource version at which to start the watch, among other things, leak a bit of the underlying implementation with options like `Recursive bool`, which indicate that the provided `key` is a prefix and all objects that match should be included in the watch. If you have ever provided the `-w` ("watch") flag when performing a `kubectl` command, especially if you have tried to watch across multiple types, you may have seen a response like `error: you may only specify a single resource type`. This is an example of the underling storage engine and the organization of the data within it flowing through to the end-user experience.

```go
Get(ctx context.Context, key string, opts GetOptions, objPtr runtime.Object) error
```

`Get` retrieves data at the given `key` and returns it in the `objPtr`. Options allow for ignoring errors related to the `key` not being found, as well as specifying constraints on the resource version of the object to be fetched.

```go
GetList(ctx context.Context, key string, opts ListOptions, listObj runtime.Object) error
```

`GetList` is quite similar to `Watch`, accepting the same set of options. However, instead of providing an interface to receive updates on matching resources, it simply returns them in a list object.

```go
GuaranteedUpdate(ctx context.Context, key string, destination runtime.Object, ignoreNotFound bool, preconditions *Preconditions, tryUpdate UpdateFunc, cachedExistingObject runtime.Object) error
```

`GuaranteedUpdate` is similar to `Delete` but is slightly more complex in that it accepts a caller-defined `UpdateFunc` in the form of `func(input runtime.Object, res ResponseMeta) (output runtime.Object, ttl *uint64, err error)`. This function is called repeatedly after preconditions are checked, retrying any failures to store the modified object. However, `tryUpdate` can also choose to exit the loop by returning an error. Updating in this fashion allows for more resilient and flexible update operations as the caller has more leeway to define whether a given state should result in conflict or not[^3].

```go
Count(key string) (int64, error)
```

`Count` is the simplest method exposed, returning the number of objects for the provided `key`. The `key` provided is frequently a prefix, but unlike some of the other methods, the caller does not have to explicitly define that it is.

---

Though we haven't ventured into any of the handlers for the Kubernetes API endpoints we are all familiar with, we can already see how some of the `kubectl` commands we run or `client-go` methods we call could map to performing these storage operations behind the scenes. However, while the `storage` interface tells us how we can interact with a storage solution, it doesn't tell us anything about how the data we pass through is actually persisted.

## Our Good Friend `etcd`

Before we go any further, I have to recommend that you go and read [Michael Gasch's](https://www.mgasch.com/) wonderful [post on `etcd` internals](https://www.mgasch.com/2021/01/listwatch-part-1/). Because of Michael's thorough write-up, we can mostly focus on how Kubernetes interacts with [`etcd`](https://etcd.io/), rather than going into detail on exactly what is happening when we read and write to our key-value store[^4].

While the `storage.Interface` we outlined above is not strictly coupled to `etcd`, you'll notice a high degree of similarity between the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API exposed by `etcd` and the interface's methods. So much so, that the [`etcd` implementation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2fba771792023756b539501cdabdb19a32bb9536/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/etcd3/store.go#L74) is relatively lightweight. To get a sense of how `etcd` works, we can download the latest release along with `etcdctl`, the official CLI.

```
$ ETCD_VER=v3.5.6

$ curl -L https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/${ETCD_VER}/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz -o /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz etcd-v3.5.6-linux-amd64/etcd etcd-v3.5.6-linux-amd64/etcdctl --strip-components=1
$ rm -f /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

> NOTE: make sure to move `etcd` and `etcdctl` to a directory in your `PATH`.

```
$ etcd --version
etcd Version: 3.5.6
Git SHA: cecbe35ce
Go Version: go1.16.15
Go OS/Arch: linux/amd64
```

If we spin up `etcd` in the background we can start performing operations with `etcdctl`.

```
$ etcd > /dev/null 2>&1 &
[1] 442084

$ etcdctl member list
8e9e05c52164694d, started, default, http://localhost:2380, http://localhost:2379, false

$ etcdctl get "" --prefix

$ etcdctl put hello world
OK

$ etcdctl get hello
hello
world

$ etcdctl put well hi
OK

$ etcdctl get "" --prefix
hello
world
well
hi

$ etcd del hello
1

$ etcdctl get "" --prefix
well
hi
```

With just a few commands, we can see the basics of the `Create`, `Delete`, `Get`, and `GetList`. We can also open up a new terminal and watch for changes on a given prefix.

```
# terminal 1

$ etcdctl watch "" --prefix
```

```
# terminal 2

$ etcdctl put isee you
OK
```

```
# terminal 1

$ etcdctl watch "" --prefix
PUT
isee
you
```

We can round out our investigation before moving on to the API Server by getting the count of keys under a given prefix.

```
$ etcdctl get "" --prefix --count-only --write-out fields
"ClusterID" : 14841639068965178418
"MemberID" : 10276657743932975437
"Revision" : 5
"RaftTerm" : 6
"More" : false
"Count" : 2
```

Make sure to shut down `etcd` before continuing.

```
$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 etcd > /dev/null 2>&1 &

$ kill %1
```

## The API Server and `etcd`

One of the quickest ways to see how Kubernetes interacts with `etcd` is by spinning up a [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster and interacting with `etcd` while the API Server is communicating with it. 

```
$ kind create cluster
```

When your cluster is up and running, you should see your single node running as a container.

```
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                       NAMES
d5ec8483dd79   kindest/node:v1.25.3   "/usr/local/bin/entrâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   127.0.0.1:34285->6443/tcp   kind-control-plane
```

If we exec into the container we can take a look at Kubernetes components in action.

```
$ docker exec -it kind-control-plane /bin/bash
root@kind-control-plane:/#
```

Using [`top`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html) we see that usual suspects are all there: `kube-controller`, `kube-apiserver`, `kube-scheduler`, `etcd`, etc.

```

Our goal today is to examine the communication between `kube-apiserver` and `etcd`. As we saw earlier, `etcdctl` is useful for querying and watching for changes. We can copy the tool onto our `kind` node to interact with our running `etcd` instance.

```
$ docker cp /usr/local/bin/etcdctl kind-control-plane:/usr/local/bin/
```

Back on the node we should see that `etcdctl` is now present.

```
$ root@kind-control-plane:/# which etcdctl
/usr/local/bin/etcdctl
```

However, if we try to connect to the `etcd` instance running as part of our Kubernetes cluster, we'll observe an error.

```
$ root@kind-control-plane:/# etcdctl get "" --prefix
{"level":"warn","ts":"2023-01-19T03:48:14.046Z","logger":"etcd-client","caller":"v3@v3.5.6/retry_interceptor.go:62","msg":"retrying of unary invoker failed","target":"etcd-endpoints://0xc0001b2000/127.0.0.1:2379","attempt":0,"error":"rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = latest balancer error: last connection error: connection closed before server preface received"}
Error: context deadline exceeded
```

Hmm, we know `kube-apiserver` is able to communicate with `etcd`, so let's looks at how it is configured.

```

```

Though not explicitly communicated in the error we saw, a safe guess here is that `etcd` is requiring authentication to connect. We can use the same key and certificates the API Server is using.

```
$ root@kind-control-plane:/# etcdctl --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.key get "" --prefix --keys-only --limit 5

```

Now that we are able to connect, using the `""` prefix allows us to view all of the keys present[^5] in our `etcd` instance. The first few keys we see indicate that we are looking at [`APIService`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#apiservice-v1-apiregistration-k8s-io) objects, which inform the API Server where the handlers for a given group are served. If we examine the value for one of these keys, we'll see data that looks a lot like what we get back when we run `kubectl get`.

The format of the keys we have observed is `/registry/<group>/<kind>/<metadata.name`. However, not all APIs are cluster-scoped like `APIService`. Let's take a look at [`ConfigMap`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#configmap-v1-core), a namespace-scoped API.

```
$ root@kind-control-plane:/# etcdctl --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.key get /registry/configmaps --prefix --keys-only
/registry/configmaps/default/kube-root-ca.crt

/registry/configmaps/kube-node-lease/kube-root-ca.crt

/registry/configmaps/kube-public/cluster-info

/registry/configmaps/kube-public/kube-root-ca.crt

/registry/configmaps/kube-system/coredns

/registry/configmaps/kube-system/extension-apiserver-authentication

/registry/configmaps/kube-system/kube-proxy

/registry/configmaps/kube-system/kube-root-ca.crt

/registry/configmaps/kube-system/kubeadm-config

/registry/configmaps/kube-system/kubelet-config

/registry/configmaps/local-path-storage/kube-root-ca.crt

/registry/configmaps/local-path-storage/local-path-config
```

Because `ConfigMap` is in the `core` API group, we don't see any `<group>` in the key name. However, we do see an additional element in the path: `<namespace>`. This brings our full format to `/registry/[<group>/]<kind>/[<namespace>/]/<metadata.name>`. If we were to list all of the `ConfigMap` objects in our cluster, we should see the same list.

```
$ root@kind-control-plane:/# kubectl get configmaps -A
NAMESPACE            NAME                                 DATA   AGE
default              kube-root-ca.crt                     1      18m
kube-node-lease      kube-root-ca.crt                     1      18m
kube-public          cluster-info                         2      18m
kube-public          kube-root-ca.crt                     1      18m
kube-system          coredns                              1      18m
kube-system          extension-apiserver-authentication   6      18m
kube-system          kube-proxy                           2      18m
kube-system          kube-root-ca.crt                     1      18m
kube-system          kubeadm-config                       1      18m
kube-system          kubelet-config                       1      18m
local-path-storage   kube-root-ca.crt                     1      18m
local-path-storage   local-path-config                    4      18m
```

We should also see that if we create a new `ConfigMap` in the cluster, it subsequently can be observed in `etcd` with the data we supply.

```
$ root@kind-control-plane:/# kubectl create configmap k8s-asa --from-literal hello=world
configmap/k8s-asa created

root@kind-control-plane:/# etcdctl --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.key get /registry/configmaps/default/k8s-asa --print-value-only

```

This time we do not get the pretty JSON returned from the values for the `APIService` keys. Why is that the case if they are both passing through the same `storage.Interface`? To understand, we need to examine the `etcd3` implementation of the interface. 

## Calling the `storage.Interface` Directly

The only[^6] in-tree implementation of the `storage.Interface` is [`etcd3`](https://github.com/kubernetes/apiserver/blob/ce86ff4a7bd822660d118d976d2fe71893d23996/pkg/storage/etcd3/store.go#L74). Though we have observed a high degree of correlation between operations supported by `etcd` and the `storage.Interface`, there is still some nuance in how the data we send to the API Server ends up getting stored, and ultimately returned. The function signature for creating a new `etcd` storage backend provides some clues as to its internal operations.

```go
func New(c *clientv3.Client, codec runtime.Codec, newFunc func() runtime.Object, prefix string, groupResource schema.GroupResource, transformer value.Transformer, pagingEnabled bool, leaseManagerConfig LeaseManagerConfig) storage.
```

While some of the arguments are fairly self-explanatory (e.g. passing a client, specifying a prefix, or specifying whether paging is enabled), others appear a bit more opaque without more context. We are going to be focusing on `codec` and `transformer` in this post as we are primarily interested in successfully fetching data from `etcd` that was put there by the `APIServer`. As one could infer from their names, `codec` and `transformer` are what dictate the difference between the data that is passed to and from the API Server handlers, and that which is stored in `etcd`. To motivate our exploration, we can construct a program that instantiates the `etcd3` implementation of `storage.Interface`, and fetches the `ConfigMap` we previously created. Instead of copying a binary onto our `kind` node, we are going to copy the necessary PKI data out of the container and port-forward the `etcd` server `Pod`.

```
# make a directory outside the container to copy PKI data
$ mkdir pki

# find the root directory for the kind node container
$ sudo ls /proc/$(docker inspect kind-control-plane | jq .[0].State.Pid)/root
bin  boot  dev	etc  home  kind  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  media  mnt	opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr	var

# copy PKI data out of container
$ sudo cp -r /proc/$(docker inspect kind-control-plane | jq .[0].State.Pid)/root/etc/kubernetes/pki/. ./pki/.

# change ownership from root to current user / group
$ sudo chown $(id -un):$(id -gn) -R ./pki
```

> Note: because the Docker daemon is running as `root`, all of the files in the container are owned by `root:root`. By changing the ownership of the copied files were are able to access them without being superuser. This is fine for our exploration here on our local machine, but in any meaningful setting Kubernetes PKI data should always be handled with care to avoid compromising the security of your cluster.

Now in a separate terminal, we can start port-forwarding the `etcd` `Pod`.

```
$ kubectl port-forward -n kube-system pod/etcd-kind-control-plane 2379:2379
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:2379 -> 2379
Forwarding from [::1]:2379 -> 2379
```

Outside of the cluster, we can create our program that will fetch the `ConfigMap` from `etcd` directly.

`main.go`
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"go.etcd.io/etcd/client/pkg/v3/transport"
	clientv3 "go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3"
	v1 "k8s.io/api/core/v1"
	"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime"
	"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer"
	"k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage"
	"k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/etcd3"
	"k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/value/encrypt/identity"
)

func main() {
	tlsConfig, err := (transport.TLSInfo{
		CertFile:       "./pki/etcd/server.crt",
		KeyFile:        "./pki/etcd/server.key",
		TrustedCAFile:  "./pki/etcd/ca.crt",
		ClientCertFile: "./pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt",
		ClientKeyFile:  "./pki/apiserver-etcd-client.key",
	}).ClientConfig()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	c, err := clientv3.New(clientv3.Config{
		Endpoints: []string{"https://127.0.0.1:2379"},
		TLS:       tlsConfig,
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	scheme := runtime.NewScheme()
	v1.AddToScheme(scheme)
	s := etcd3.New(c, serializer.NewCodecFactory(scheme).LegacyCodec(v1.SchemeGroupVersion), nil, "registry", v1.Resource("ConfigMap"), identity.NewEncryptCheckTransformer(), true, etcd3.NewDefaultLeaseManagerConfig())
	cm := &v1.ConfigMap{}
	if err := s.Get(context.Background(), "configmaps/default/k8s-asa", storage.GetOptions{}, cm); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(cm.Data)
}
```

### Devising a `runtime.Scheme`

To connect with `etcd`, we must supply paths to the various certificates and keys copied in the PKI data from the container. We also need to specify the address(es), of the `etcd` server(s). In this case we are port-forwarding a single server on `localhost`. Once we have our `etcd` client, we need to instantiate the storage implementation. We do so by first constructing a [`runtime.Scheme`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/0fcc3dbd55732c501d4948840f639e00a2fe33c5/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/scheme.go#L46). If you have ever written a Kubernetes controller, you are likely already familiar with schemes. In short, a `scheme` informs the consumer how to convert between a Kubernetes type and an internal Go representation of that type.

```go
type Scheme struct {
	// gvkToType allows one to figure out the go type of an object with
	// the given version and name.
	gvkToType map[schema.GroupVersionKind]reflect.Type

	// typeToGVK allows one to find metadata for a given go object.
	// The reflect.Type we index by should *not* be a pointer.
	typeToGVK map[reflect.Type][]schema.GroupVersionKind

	// unversionedTypes are transformed without conversion in ConvertToVersion.
	unversionedTypes map[reflect.Type]schema.GroupVersionKind

	// unversionedKinds are the names of kinds that can be created in the context of any group
	// or version
	// TODO: resolve the status of unversioned types.
	unversionedKinds map[string]reflect.Type

	// Map from version and resource to the corresponding func to convert
	// resource field labels in that version to internal version.
	fieldLabelConversionFuncs map[schema.GroupVersionKind]FieldLabelConversionFunc

	// defaulterFuncs is a map to funcs to be called with an object to provide defaulting
	// the provided object must be a pointer.
	defaulterFuncs map[reflect.Type]func(interface{})

	// converter stores all registered conversion functions. It also has
	// default converting behavior.
	converter *conversion.Converter

	// versionPriority is a map of groups to ordered lists of versions for those groups indicating the
	// default priorities of these versions as registered in the scheme
	versionPriority map[string][]string

	// observedVersions keeps track of the order we've seen versions during type registration
	observedVersions []schema.GroupVersion

	// schemeName is the name of this scheme.  If you don't specify a name, the stack of the NewScheme caller will be used.
	// This is useful for error reporting to indicate the origin of the scheme.
	schemeName string
}
```

A `scheme` starts out as empty, but new types can be added, "teaching" the `scheme` how to convert them. In our example program, we are using the `core` API's convenience function [`v1.AddToScheme`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/0fcc3dbd55732c501d4948840f639e00a2fe33c5/staging/src/k8s.io/api/core/v1/register.go#L41) to register all `core` API types. Ultimately, this function calls the [`AddKnownTypeWithName()`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/91cfe7f0c30ee52fe7c63778357838c6f4ca63c6/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/scheme.go#L156) on the `runtime.Scheme` for each type being registered. This adds the type to the conversion maps and registers a self-conversion function if available.

```go
func (s *Scheme) AddKnownTypeWithName(gvk schema.GroupVersionKind, obj Object) {
	s.addObservedVersion(gvk.GroupVersion())
	t := reflect.TypeOf(obj)
	if len(gvk.Version) == 0 {
		panic(fmt.Sprintf("version is required on all types: %s %v", gvk, t))
	}
	if t.Kind() != reflect.Pointer {
		panic("All types must be pointers to structs.")
	}
	t = t.Elem()
	if t.Kind() != reflect.Struct {
		panic("All types must be pointers to structs.")
	}

	if oldT, found := s.gvkToType[gvk]; found && oldT != t {
		panic(fmt.Sprintf("Double registration of different types for %v: old=%v.%v, new=%v.%v in scheme %q", gvk, oldT.PkgPath(), oldT.Name(), t.PkgPath(), t.Name(), s.schemeName))
	}

	s.gvkToType[gvk] = t

	for _, existingGvk := range s.typeToGVK[t] {
		if existingGvk == gvk {
			return
		}
	}
	s.typeToGVK[t] = append(s.typeToGVK[t], gvk)

	// if the type implements DeepCopyInto(<obj>), register a self-conversion
	if m := reflect.ValueOf(obj).MethodByName("DeepCopyInto"); m.IsValid() && m.Type().NumIn() == 1 && m.Type().NumOut() == 0 && m.Type().In(0) == reflect.TypeOf(obj) {
		if err := s.AddGeneratedConversionFunc(obj, obj, func(a, b interface{}, scope conversion.Scope) error {
			// copy a to b
			reflect.ValueOf(a).MethodByName("DeepCopyInto").Call([]reflect.Value{reflect.ValueOf(b)})
			// clear TypeMeta to match legacy reflective conversion
			b.(Object).GetObjectKind().SetGroupVersionKind(schema.GroupVersionKind{})
			return nil
		}); err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}
}
```

Ever wondered where all of the methods in your `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` files are used? This is it! The function uses [reflection](https://go.dev/blog/laws-of-reflection) on the passed `struct` pointer to determine whether a `DeepCopyInto()` method is present, and, if so, registers it. For the `ConfigMap` type, [the `DeepCopyInto()` method](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/0fcc3dbd55732c501d4948840f639e00a2fe33c5/staging/src/k8s.io/api/core/v1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go#L550) looks as follows.

```go
func (in *ConfigMap) DeepCopyInto(out *ConfigMap) {
	*out = *in
	out.TypeMeta = in.TypeMeta
	in.ObjectMeta.DeepCopyInto(&out.ObjectMeta)
	if in.Immutable != nil {
		in, out := &in.Immutable, &out.Immutable
		*out = new(bool)
		**out = **in
	}
	if in.Data != nil {
		in, out := &in.Data, &out.Data
		*out = make(map[string]string, len(*in))
		for key, val := range *in {
			(*out)[key] = val
		}
	}
	if in.BinaryData != nil {
		in, out := &in.BinaryData, &out.BinaryData
		*out = make(map[string][]byte, len(*in))
		for key, val := range *in {
			var outVal []byte
			if val == nil {
				(*out)[key] = nil
			} else {
				in, out := &val, &outVal
				*out = make([]byte, len(*in))
				copy(*out, *in)
			}
			(*out)[key] = outVal
		}
	}
	return
}
```

### Encoding and Decoding

We can use our `scheme` that is knowledgeable of `core` API types to construct the first utility we are interested in: a `codec`. Like any codec, the `codec` we construct will be capable of encoding and decoding. The [`runtime.Codec` interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/f21c60341740874703ce12e070eda6cdddfd9f7b/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/interfaces.go#L112) is an alias for another interface, [`runtime.Serializer`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/f21c60341740874703ce12e070eda6cdddfd9f7b/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/interfaces.go#L104), with the latter indicating that encoding and decoding should consider versioning.

```go
// Serializer is the core interface for transforming objects into a serialized format and back.
// Implementations may choose to perform conversion of the object, but no assumptions should be made.
type Serializer interface {
	Encoder
	Decoder
}

// Codec is a Serializer that deals with the details of versioning objects. It offers the same
// interface as Serializer, so this is a marker to consumers that care about the version of the objects
// they receive.
type Codec Serializer
```

Our call to [`serializer.NewCodecFactory()`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/f21c60341740874703ce12e070eda6cdddfd9f7b/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer/codec_factory.go#L176) constructs a [set of serializers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/f21c60341740874703ce12e070eda6cdddfd9f7b/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer/codec_factory.go#L91) for each of the following formats:
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
- [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/)
- [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/)

We then call [`LegacyCodec()`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/cc60df95959bc4e6422ff05dc3d7c6ba3817bff0/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer/codec_factory.go#L263) to access the encoder and decoder that make use of the underlying scheme and serializers. Importantly, when given a `struct` pointer, this codec will always encode to JSON. We are only performing a `Get()` in our program, but we can demonstrate encoding with a smaller program that just sends the output to `stdout`.

`encode.go`
```go
package main

import (
	"os"

	v1 "k8s.io/api/core/v1"
	metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
	"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime"
	"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer"
)

func main() {
	scheme := runtime.NewScheme()
	v1.AddToScheme(scheme)
	if err := serializer.NewCodecFactory(scheme).LegacyCodec(v1.SchemeGroupVersion).Encode(&v1.ConfigMap{
		ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{
			Name: "hello",
		},
		TypeMeta: metav1.TypeMeta{
			Kind:       "ConfigMap",
			APIVersion: "v1",
		},
	}, os.Stdout); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

Running this program demonstrates the default encoding using the JSON serializer.

```
$ go run encode.go
{"kind":"ConfigMap","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"hello","creationTimestamp":null}}
```

This aligns with the behavior we saw with `APIService`, but not `ConfigMap`. The reason is that these two APIs are served by different servers. In a [previous post on Custom Resource validation](https://danielmangum.com/posts/how-kubernetes-validates-custom-resources/) I described the structure of the API Server chain. The first server in the chain is `kube-aggregator`, which is responsible for [serving the `APIService` API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/cc60df95959bc4e6422ff05dc3d7c6ba3817bff0/staging/src/k8s.io/kube-aggregator/pkg/apis/apiregistration/register.go#L48). It is followed by `kube-apiserver`, which is followed by `apiextensions-apiserver`. However, when building the delegating chain, the servers are [constructed in reverse order](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2f2240400391add53983c9c04cb91ec8a8df5c67/cmd/kube-apiserver/app/server.go#L204). When the [`ServerRunOptions`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2f2240400391add53983c9c04cb91ec8a8df5c67/cmd/kube-apiserver/app/options/options.go#L43), which are exposed to the end user via flags, are constructed, the default storage media type in the `etcd` options is [set to](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2f2240400391add53983c9c04cb91ec8a8df5c67/cmd/kube-apiserver/app/options/options.go#L136) `application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf`.

For `kube-apiserver`, this ultimately is passed down to [`NewDefaultStorageFactory()`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8fdaac238e4f7f560066ea3a324cdbcaae564ac9/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/storage/storage_factory.go#L148), then to [`NewStorageCodec()`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8fdaac238e4f7f560066ea3a324cdbcaae564ac9/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/storage/storage_codec.go#L43), which uses it to [extract a serializer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8fdaac238e4f7f560066ea3a324cdbcaae564ac9/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/storage/storage_codec.go#L50) that matches the media type. The result is a `runtime.Codec` that encodes to protobuf for storage, while supporting decoding from JSON, YAML, or protobuf.

```go
	mediaType, _, err := mime.ParseMediaType(opts.StorageMediaType)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("%q is not a valid mime-type", opts.StorageMediaType)
	}

	supportedMediaTypes := opts.StorageSerializer.SupportedMediaTypes()
	serializer, ok := runtime.SerializerInfoForMediaType(supportedMediaTypes, mediaType)
	if !ok {
		supportedMediaTypeList := make([]string, len(supportedMediaTypes))
		for i, mediaType := range supportedMediaTypes {
			supportedMediaTypeList[i] = mediaType.MediaType
		}
		return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("unable to find serializer for %q, supported media types: %v", mediaType, supportedMediaTypeList)
	}
```

The same is not true for `kube-aggregator`, which [copies the `etcd` configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2f2240400391add53983c9c04cb91ec8a8df5c67/cmd/kube-apiserver/app/aggregator.go#L83), and [instantiates a `LegacyCodec`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2f2240400391add53983c9c04cb91ec8a8df5c67/cmd/kube-apiserver/app/aggregator.go#L85), but does not honor the default media type, meaning that `APIService` objects fall back to the default of encoding to JSON.

### Undergoing Transformation

Compared to encoding and decoding, transformers are much simpler. The [`value.Transformer` interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8fdaac238e4f7f560066ea3a324cdbcaae564ac9/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/value/transformer.go#L44) encompasses just two methods: `TransformFromStorage()` and `TransformToStorage()`.

```go
// Transformer allows a value to be transformed before being read from or written to the underlying store. The methods
// must be able to undo the transformation caused by the other.
type Transformer interface {
	// TransformFromStorage may transform the provided data from its underlying storage representation or return an error.
	// Stale is true if the object on disk is stale and a write to etcd should be issued, even if the contents of the object
	// have not changed.
	TransformFromStorage(ctx context.Context, data []byte, dataCtx Context) (out []byte, stale bool, err error)
	// TransformToStorage may transform the provided data into the appropriate form in storage or return an error.
	TransformToStorage(ctx context.Context, data []byte, dataCtx Context) (out []byte, err error)
}
```

The canonical example of a transformer is one that performs some form of encryption on the data being stored. There are a [variety of implementations](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/8fdaac238e4f7f560066ea3a324cdbcaae564ac9/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/value/encrypt), including [support for external key management services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kms-provider/). However, we are just using [the `identity` transformer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8fdaac238e4f7f560066ea3a324cdbcaae564ac9/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/value/encrypt/identity/identity.go#L39), which does nothing when [transforming to storage](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8fdaac238e4f7f560066ea3a324cdbcaae564ac9/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/value/encrypt/identity/identity.go#L55), and just verifies that the data is _not_ encrypted when [transforming from storage](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8fdaac238e4f7f560066ea3a324cdbcaae564ac9/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/value/encrypt/identity/identity.go#L44).

### Finding Our `ConfigMap`

We've done a lot of explaining, let's see it in action! Stepping through our relatively small program in a debugger helps unearth some of the hidden complexity. We can set a breakpoint at the location in which we instantiate the `etcd3` implementation of `storage.Interface` to step into the construction of our `codec`.

![k8s-asa-storage-debug-0](../../static/k8s-asa-storage-debug-0.png)


We don't pass any mutators, so we move immediately to constructing the JSON, YAML, and protobuf serializers for our `scheme`.

![k8s-asa-storage-debug-1](../../static/k8s-asa-storage-debug-1.png)

Next, the `newCodecFactory()` function is called, which appends all serializers as `decoders`, and sets the JSON serializer as the `legacySerializer`, which will eventually be used as our `encoder`.

![k8s-asa-storage-debug-2](../../static/k8s-asa-storage-debug-2.png)

When we invoke `LegacyCodec()` with the proper `schema.GroupVersion`, we get our implementation of `runtime.Codec`.

![k8s-asa-storage-debug-3](../../static/k8s-asa-storage-debug-3.png)

With our `codec` in place, we are ready to fetch the `ConfigMap` data from `etcd` and decode it into our passed `struct` pointer. The call to `Get()` can omit the `/registry/` prefix as we set it as the default when constructing the implmentation. The bulk of the work in this method is performed by the `transformer` and the `codec`, but because our `transformer` is mostly a no-op, we are primarily interested in decoding.

![k8s-asa-storage-debug-4](../../static/k8s-asa-storage-debug-4.png)

We can tell that the data fetched from `etcd` is in protobuf format based on the magic number at the beginning of the value.

```
"k8s\x00\n\x0f\n\x02v1\x12\tConfigMap\x12\xb6\x01\n\xa3\x01\n\ak8s-asa\x12\x00\x1a\adefault\"\x00*$ebc5e916-fba3-4a27-be4b-f505c12562462\x008\x00B\b\b\x99\xfb\xbb\x9e\x06\x10\x00\x8a\x01V\n\x0ekubectl-create\x12\x06Update\x1a\x02v1\"\b\b\x99\xfb\xbb\x9e\x06\x10\x002\bFieldsV1:\"\n {\"f:data\":{\".\":{},\"f:hello\":{}}}B\x00\x12\x0e\n\x05hello\x12\x05world\x1a\x00\"\x00"
```

The protobuf [serializer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/674eb36f92dcea33e47ac07d71d88ebe9f5c4c6d/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer/protobuf/protobuf.go#L45) uses the prefix to identify whether it can successfully decode the value into its Go definition.

```go
var (
	// protoEncodingPrefix serves as a magic number for an encoded protobuf message on this serializer. All
	// proto messages serialized by this schema will be preceded by the bytes 0x6b 0x38 0x73, with the fourth
	// byte being reserved for the encoding style. The only encoding style defined is 0x00, which means that
	// the rest of the byte stream is a message of type k8s.io.kubernetes.pkg.runtime.Unknown (proto2).
	//
	// See k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/generated.proto for details of the runtime.Unknown message.
	//
	// This encoding scheme is experimental, and is subject to change at any time.
	protoEncodingPrefix = []byte{0x6b, 0x38, 0x73, 0x00}
)
```

As we iterate through the decoders, we skip our JSON and YAML variants, before the protobuf decoder recognizes the data.

![k8s-asa-storage-debug-5](../../static/k8s-asa-storage-debug-5.png)

After validating the length of the data, we find ourselves back at using our `runtime.Scheme` (`runtime.ObjectTyper` and `runtime.ObjectCreater`) in order to convert the data into our Go representation of a `ConfigMap`.

![k8s-asa-storage-debug-6](../../static/k8s-asa-storage-debug-6.png)

Now that we have our object, we can print our data and see that it matches the `ConfigMap` we created at the beginning via `kubectl`.

> Reminder: we must be port-forwarding `etcd` to be able to connect successfully.

```
$ go run main.go
map[hello:world]
```

## Closing Thoughts

This has been the first installment in the [Kubernetes API Server Adventures series](https://danielmangum.com/categories/kubernetes-api-server-adventures/). While there is an endless amount of information about how to use Kubernetes, and a fair amount about how to extend it, I have found there to be relatively little information about the code itself. While the vast majority of readers may not be interacting with the code on a daily basis, understanding what is happening behind the scenes helps us reason about why the system may be exhibiting unexpected behavior. It may also lead us to change parts of the system to better fit our use-cases.

[^1]: Generic is used in a relative sense here. As we'll see throughout this series, many of the components in Kubernetes have grown to have subtle dependencies on one another, meaning that saying any one component is generic typically indicates that it can be used in multiple areas of the Kubernetes code base, but not necessarily outside of it.
[^2]: The exact behavior described here is not strictly required by the interface, but is in reality [how the `etcd` implementation functions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/3154010eec3488dd64110e3ca6c4ba0b5ac61310/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/etcd3/store.go#L271).
[^3]: You may already be thinking about different types of updates in Kubernetes and what guarantees they offer.
[^4]: Rest assured, we will be coming back here in a future post. A [primary motivation](https://danielmangum.com/posts/k8s-asa-welcome/) of this series is gaining an understanding of where various parts of the API server break down. `etcd` may very well be a limiting factor in some of the use cases we explore.
[^5]: Important flags here include specifying the provided key is a prefix (`--prefix`), indicating that we only want a list of keys (`--keys-only`), and limiting to only 5 keys (`--limit`).
[^6]: This could be disputed as [`Cacher`](https://github.com/kubernetes/apiserver/blob/f928c72a9f84c5422dc1ea70919ded7570a99d12/pkg/storage/cacher/cacher.go#L241) is technically an implementation as well. However, it requires an underlying implementation in order to perform its operations. We'll be looking at caching extensively in a future post.
