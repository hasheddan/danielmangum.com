Most people are familiar with the concept of **Unit Testing**, but I have found that **Integration Testing** can be a little harder to interpret. For the purpose of this article, we will work from the following simple definition of an integration test:

> The practice of testing interactions between a service and any other services it depends on.

The best way to understand what this means is by creating an example. We will be using a simple RESTful API server the connects to a database as our example service. Before we get started, it is important to introduce the concept of **Mocks**. As mentioned previously, we want to see how our service interacts with dependencies, but sometimes the dependencies don't exist yet or are not suitable to be used for testing. A mock is simply a representation of a dependency that interacts with other services in the same manner, but doesn't actually perform all of the same tasks behind the scenes. For example, our mock database may allow a service to establish a "connection" and run queries, but will actually just return data from static CSV files. Without any further ado, let's go ahead and get started!

# A First Pass at the API Service

Golang makes it very easy to build an http server quickly with its `net/http` package.

Let's start out with the simplest implementation:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there, I love %s!", r.URL.Path[1:])
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

If you run this process, it will simply listen for requests on port 8080 and respond with "Hi there, I love [instert first argument in URL path here]".

This is great for a small API, but it is not very reusable. Let's look at a more modular approach.
