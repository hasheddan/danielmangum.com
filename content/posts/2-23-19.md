*Disclaimer: The purpose of this post is to demonstrate how to do effective mocking in Golang, but as I wrote it I felt the need to include many other concepts (modular code, testing, object-oriented programming, project directory structure, etc.) before finally landing on mocking. In a way, I feel like this makes sense because mocking is only possible in Golang if you have been careful to write your code in a "mockable" way. Or maybe I am just a lousy rambling writer. I'll let you be the judge.*

Most people are familiar with the concept of **Unit Testing**, but I have found that **Integration Testing** can be a little harder to interpret. For the purpose of this article, we will work from the following simple definition of an integration test:

> The practice of testing interactions between a service and any other services it depends on.

The best way to understand what this means is by creating an example. We will be using a simple REST API server the connects to a database as our example service. Before we get started, it is important to introduce the concept of **Mocks**. As mentioned previously, we want to see how our service interacts with dependencies, but sometimes the dependencies don't exist yet or are not suitable to be used for testing. A mock is simply a representation of a dependency that interacts with other services in the same manner, but doesn't actually perform all of the same tasks behind the scenes. For example, our mock database may allow a service to establish a "connection" and run queries, but will actually just return data from static CSV files. Without any further ado, let's go ahead and get started!

# A First Pass at the API Service

Golang makes it very easy to build an http server quickly with its `net/http` package.

Let's start out with the simplest implementation:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "This is an API endpoint.")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

If you run this process, it will simply listen for requests on port 8080 and respond with "This is an API endpoint.".

This is great for a small API, but it is not very reusable. Let's look at a more modular approach.

# A Reusable API Service

The first thing we will do is setup our basic directory structure. When building any Go program, I usually adhere to some adaptation of the [Golang Standards project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout). Therefore, we will layout our directory structure as follows:

```
gowebserver/
│   README.md   
│
└───cmd/
│   │
│   └───gowebserver/
│       │   main.go
│   
└───pkg
│   │
│   └───server/
│       │   server.go
```
The cmd/ directory will be our entry point for the program, and the pkg/ directory will contain all packages we build to accomplish our goals (just a server at first). This structure is indicative of how we want to think about writing modular code. The server, and any other packages we build are meant to be used in by the process. Packages should be self-contained items that come with their own API to be used. This concecpt is somewhat similar to object-oriented programming, although there is much (needless) debate about whether [Go is in fact an object-oriented language](https://flaviocopes.com/golang-is-go-object-oriented/).

Let's begin by defining our server. It will be a basic wrapper around the standard library's http server, but we will also add a property to enable / disable logging.
```
type server struct {
	logging bool
	srv     http.Server
}
```
Next we will implement the methods that we require for our server. While Golang does not support inheritance, it does allow structs to automatically implement interfaces if the struct implements all of the methods defined in the interface. We will define the methods we want our server struct to implement in the Server interface.
```
type Server interface {
    Start() error
    Stop() error
    Handle() error
}
```
