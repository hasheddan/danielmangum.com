I got involved in the Kubernetes community right after finishing school,
primarily by working on the tooling used to test and release each of the
components of the project. From the beginning, I was shown a tremendous amount
of respect and care, and that has remained constant since. That being said, over
the past two years I have seen my interests evolve rapidly. I have always been
interested in "low-level" software, but my view of what that means has changed
fairly dramatically. When I was in school, I viewed Kubernetes as low-level
systems software, but the more I have pursued a fundamental understanding of
computers, that view has shifted to Kubernetes feeling rather high in the
proverbial "stack". As I have sought out opportunities to get "closer to the
metal", the time I had previously reserved for my upstream contributions has
been more dedicated to projects and learning around topics like processor
design, FPGAs, and compilers.

This isn't to say that there isn't plenty of work to do in Kubernetes that
requires knowledge of lower level concepts. For example, much of the work [SIG
Node](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node) does
revolves around fairly complex Linux capabilities. I would not be surprised if I
made an effort to become more involved in those efforts at some point in the
future. That being said, with a very demanding day job at
[Upbound](https://www.upbound.io/), a rapidly growing open source community
around [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/), and my aforementioned shift in
interests, **I have made the difficult decision to step down as a SIG Release
Tech Lead**.

After seeing so many folks step away from open source communities due to toxic,
exclusive behavior, I consider myself extremely fortunate to walk away with
nothing but positive things to say about the folks I have interacted with and
worked alongside. I want to take a moment to mention a few of those folks and
the tremendous impact they have had on me.

[Stephen Augustus](https://twitter.com/stephenaugustus), [Lauri
Apple](https://twitter.com/Moinmoinapfel), [Sascha
Grunert](https://twitter.com/saschagrunert), and [Jeremy
Rickard](https://twitter.com/jrrickard) (as well as [Tim
Pepper](https://twitter.com/pythomit) and [Jorge
Alarcon](https://twitter.com/alejandrox135)) have been my [SIG
Release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release) family, and I have had the
tremendous opportunity to learn from and grow alongside each of them. While
everyone knows it at this point, Stephen is one of the most tremendous human
beings I have ever encountered. From the day I applied to the Kubernetes Release
Team, Stephen has been a mentor, a friend, and an inspiration. Sascha and Jeremy
have had somewhat similar journeys as I have over the past few years (though I
dare not compare my impact to the tremendous work they have done and continue to
do). It has been a joy to learn and take on more responsibility as they have
done the same. Lauri... words cannot describe what I have learned from Lauri.
She is one of the most determined, resilient, and caring folks I have ever
encountered in open source, and she is all about the best outcome for the
community. She has reshaped much of the processes around how folks work together
in the Kubernetes community, and I have applied much of the knowledge she has
shared in other aspects of my professional and personal life.

[Adolfo Garc√≠a Veytia](https://twitter.com/puerco) and [Carlos
Panato](https://twitter.com/comedordexis) are a major reason why I am stepping
away (in a good way!). While I have been a Tech Lead, they have been leading me
in the time, effort, and care they put into SIG Release and the [Release
Engineering](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/release-engineering)
subproject. I am so grateful to call them my friends, and with their [recent
promotions to Tech Leads](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5807), I
have full confidence that the responsibilities I have carried will be handled
with even more expertise with them running the show.

My first role in the Kubernetes community was as a Release Team Shadow on the
[CI
Signal](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/release-team/role-handbooks/ci-signal)
team. This team will always share a special place in my heart, and is something
I particularly enjoyed because it requires deep technical knowledge of
Kubernetes, all of the testing infrastructure, and the organizational structure
and responsibilities of various groups in the community. I had the privilege to
shadow [Alena Varkockova](https://twitter.com/alenkacz) during my first cycle on
the team, which undoubtedly led me to continue to pursue more responsibility in
the community. While I was still learning, Alena empowered me, invested time in
helping me advance, and generally showed a great deal of kindness. I hope that I
have reflected at least some of those values towards others in the community who
have come after me. Another important individual from my work on CI Signal is
[Rob Kielty](https://twitter.com/RobKielty). Rob got started in the community by
shadowing me after I had moved into the CI Signal lead role, and immediately
showed a great deal of interest and investment. Rob then became the CI Signal
lead himself, and has continued to invest in folks who have held the position in
subsequent cycles. I am grateful to have been able to work with Rob on those
teams, as well as livestreams, documentation efforts, and more.

Lastly, there are a few folks that are leaders in the community outside of SIG
Release, some of whom I have interacted with more than others, but all of whom
have been inspirations to me.

There are countless others who are not mentioned here that have also had a large
impact on me and the community. Thank you to all of you for making this one of
the best experiences of my life. I will still be around, but will not be taking
on any formal positions in the Kubernetes community for the foreseeable future.
Please feel free to reach out at any time if I can be of help. Onwards and
upwards!
