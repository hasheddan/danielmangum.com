I have recently been working on tuning circuits, which typically consist of an
[inductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor) and a
[capacitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor) (i.e. an [LC
circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit)). For those not familiar with
inductors, they are passive components that store energy in a magnetic field.
They oppose changes in current, meaning that they pass [direct current
(DC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current) and block [alternating
current (AC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current).

While there are many types of inductors, ferrite core inductors are useful
because the high [magnetic
permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)) of
ferrite leads to a significant increase in induction. One common use case for
ferrite core inductors is [ferrite loopstick
antennas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_antenna#Ferrite_loop_antenna) in AM
radios, where the inductor acts as both an antenna that interacts with the
magnetic component of the [carrier
wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_wave), and a component of the tuning
circuit. Even the earliest transistor AM radios, such as the [Regency
TR-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_TR-1) and Sony
[TR-55](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-55), used ferrite loopstick antennas.

While inductors can be difficult to work with, they are fairly easy to make with
basic supplies. Doing so allows you to manipulate the design of the inductor to
fit the necessary attributes for your application.

## An Air Core Inductor

In order to observe ferrite’s impact on inductance, we can start by creating an
inductor consisting of only a wire coil, or an “air core”. To make it easier to
reuse in the future, we can create the coil by wrapping it around a ferrite rod,
then slide it off. I typically will use a piece of paper (such as a sticky note)
to make it easier to remove the coil, or move it to a different position on the
core material.

We’ll start, somewhat arbitrarily, with 30 turns of [28 AWG magnet
wire](https://a.co/d/hc3JUOX) around the core. Starting by creating a small loop
and feeding one end of the wire through it helps to keep the coil from
unraveling.

{{< center-img src="../../static/ferrite_core_inductors_1.jpg" alt="ferrite-core-inductors-1" >}}

We can also use tape to secure the core to the paper to keep it intact as we
move and test it. There are a variety of strategies that can be leveraged to
measure inductance, but we’ll use an LCR (inductance, capacitance, resistance)
meter for convenience. I have the [DE-5000](https://a.co/d/ienoWFn), which is an
affordable, decent quality option. Because the magnet wire is enameled, we need
to strip the ends before we can measure with the LCR meter. A box cutter, craft
knife, or sandpaper can be used. You should be able to see the exposed copper
at the ends after the enamel is removed.

After stripping, the LCR meter alligator clips attachment can be used to clamp
onto each of the ends of the coil.

As expected, the measured inductance is quite low (`5.3 uH`).

## Adding a Ferrite Rod

As previously mentioned, wrapping the coil around a ferrite core increases the
inductance. I ordered a set of [ferrite rods](https://a.co/d/3yE9bz5), which
arrived with some intact and some broken into smaller pieces. We can start with
one of the broken rods so that we can see the impact of increasing the length
later. This shorter rod is `~85 mm`.

{{< center-img src="../../static/ferrite_core_inductors_4.jpg" alt="ferrite-core-inductors-4" >}}

Since we used the ferrite rod to wrap the coil, we can easily slide it back on.
As expected, we see an inductance reading of `66.4 uH`, an order of magnitude
larger than that of the air coil.

{{< center-img src="../../static/ferrite_core_inductors_5.jpg" alt="ferrite-core-inductors-5" >}}

## Using a Longer Ferrite Rod

The untainted rod is `137 mm`, about 60% longer than the broken rod we
previously tested.

{{< center-img src="../../static/ferrite_core_inductors_6.jpg" alt="ferrite-core-inductors-6" >}}

Simply moving our coil to one of these longer rods increases the inductance from
`66.4 uH` to `78.9 uH`.

{{< center-img src="../../static/ferrite_core_inductors_7.jpg" alt="ferrite-core-inductors-7" >}}

## Moving Position on the Ferrite Rod

Another thing we can do to change the inductance is changing the position on the
ferrite rod. You may have noticed that when testing the longer ferrite rod, the
coil was positioned close to one end. The closer the coil is to the center of
the rod, the greater the inductance. Compared to moving from an air core to a
ferrite core, the change is minimal (`78.9 uH` to `85.0 uH`). However, sliding
the coil along the rod is much easier than adding or replacing an existing rod
in a circuit, making it a useful strategy for small adjustments.

## Increasing the Length of the Coil

We can also increase the inductance by increasing the length of the coil, while
maintaining the same density. This has a much larger impact on inductance, but
either involves winding a new coil, or splicing a wire to one end of an existing
coil. In measuring a coil I previously wound with 150 turns, we can see the
inductance increases to `2.061 mH`, or `2,061 uH`.

## Optionality with Taps

Increasing the number of turns is a fairly involved change to make. It would be
easier if you could easily test and move from one level of inductance to
another. One way to do so is by installing “taps” in the coil. There are a
number of ways that you can go about installing taps.

- While winding the coil, cut it every X turns, then wind it together with a new
  strand of wire, then continue winding. With this strategy, the tap wires are
  pre-installed in the event that you need to use them.
- Create small loops every X turns as you are winding the coil. When a tap is
  needed at one of the loops, remove the enamel from the loop and from a short
  strand of wire, then attach the short strand of wire to the loop by passing it
  through and twisting it back around itself. This is a non-destructive strategy
  that avoids adding unnecessary taps, while making it easy to add new ones as
  needed.
- Wind the coil to the maximum desired length, then remove the enamel from the
  desired tap location and solder a short wire to the location. This takes more
  effort, but can be done to any existing inductor coil.

In the previous image, you may have noticed another wire protruding from the
coil `~1/5th` the total length (`~30` turns) from the start of the coil. On this
long coil, I installed taps every `~30` turns, then attached a wire at the first
tap. While not exact, we can see that the measured inductance at this tap (`97.7
uH`) is fairly close to the shorter coil we measured at the center of a ferrite
rod of similar length (`85.0 uH`).

{{< center-img src="../../static/ferrite_core_inductors_10.jpg" alt="ferrite-core-inductors-10" >}}

Another use case for taps is to effectively divide the coil into two inductors,
with [inductive coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_coupling)
allowing passing of a signal from one to the other. This is common in AM radios,
such as those mentioned at the beginning of this post.

Volts](https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/restoring-the-worlds-first-transistor-radio))

Separating the tuning circuit from the rest of the radio’s amplification and
filtering stages helps avoid negatively impacting the sensitivity of the tuning
circuit (i.e. its [Q factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor)) due to
loading, while also reducing the potential for [parasitic
oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_oscillation). This can be
accomplished via a tap, or by two completely separate coils, potentially sharing
the same core.

## Other Strategies

There are many more strategies in addition to those explored in this post. For
example, the type of wire, the guage of the wire, and the diameter of the coil
can also all be modified to alter inductance. While it is possible to [calculate
the inductance of a
solenoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid#Inductance), and doing so is
certainly directionally useful, variations in materials make constructing and
measuring necessary.
