To start of the series, we are just going to get setup to do some exploration. I
am going to assume you will not primarily be using a RISC-V machine[^1], so we
need to configure our local development environment for cross-platform
compiling, emulation, and debugging.

## Installing Tools

As the title of this post suggests, we are going to install the RISC-V GNU
toolchain for our C compiler (`gcc`) and our debugger (`gdb`). We'll be using
the 64-bit variant of the RISC-V ISA throughout this series. If you are running
Ubuntu, the easiest way to install the toolchain is by by downloading the
[latest release](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/releases) from the
RISC-V GNU toolchain GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/releases). However,
there are also extensive instructions for how to compile from source in the
[README.md](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/blob/master/README.md).
This will provide you with all of the following tools:

```

riscv64-unknown-elf-addr2line      riscv64-unknown-elf-elfedit        riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-ranlib     riscv64-unknown-elf-gprof          riscv64-unknown-elf-ranlib
riscv64-unknown-elf-ar             riscv64-unknown-elf-g++            riscv64-unknown-elf-gcov           riscv64-unknown-elf-ld             riscv64-unknown-elf-readelf
riscv64-unknown-elf-as             riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc            riscv64-unknown-elf-gcov-dump      riscv64-unknown-elf-ld.bfd         riscv64-unknown-elf-size
riscv64-unknown-elf-c++            riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0      riscv64-unknown-elf-gcov-tool      riscv64-unknown-elf-nm             riscv64-unknown-elf-strings
riscv64-unknown-elf-c++filt        riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-ar         riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb            riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy        riscv64-unknown-elf-strip
riscv64-unknown-elf-cpp            riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-nm         riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb-add-index  riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump

```

So we can now compile and run a debugger for RISC-V, but we won't be able to
actually run our programs without emulation. [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) is
one of the most popular and widely used emulation platforms in the world. It
offers full-system and user-mode emulation[^2] for a wide variety of platforms,
including RISC-V. There are instructions for installing on Linux, macOS, and
Windows on the [downloads page](https://www.qemu.org/download), as well as links
to source and build instructions. After installing, you should have binaries for
each of the following platforms:

```

qemu-aarch64              qemu-ga                   qemu-microblaze           qemu-mipsn32el            qemu-ppc64le              qemu-sparc                qemu-system-riscv64
qemu-aarch64_be           qemu-hppa                 qemu-microblazeel         qemu-nbd                  qemu-pr-helper            qemu-sparc32plus          qemu-system-x86_64
qemu-alpha                qemu-i386                 qemu-mips                 qemu-nios2                qemu-riscv32              qemu-sparc64              qemu-system-x86_64-spice
qemu-arm                  qemu-img                  qemu-mips64               qemu-or1k                 qemu-riscv64              qemu-storage-daemon       qemu-tilegx
qemu-armeb                qemu-io                   qemu-mips64el             qemu-ppc                  qemu-s390x                qemu-system-aarch64       qemu-x86_64
qemu-cris                 qemu-m68k                 qemu-mipsel               qemu-ppc64                qemu-sh4                  qemu-system-arm           qemu-xtensa
qemu-edid                 qemu-make-debian-root     qemu-mipsn32              qemu-ppc64abi32           qemu-sh4eb                qemu-system-i386          qemu-xtensaeb

```

You'll see a few for RISC-V: `qemu-riscv32`, `qemu-riscv64`,
`qemu-system-riscv64`. The first two are the 32-bit and 64-bit variants for
user-mode emulation, and the third is the 64-bit variant for full-system
emulation.

## A First Example

Now that we have our tools in place, let's use them! We'll start by compiling a
very small C program:

`sum.c`
```c

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int num1 = 1;
    int num2 = 2;
    int sum = num1 + num2;

    printf("The sum is: %d", sum);
    return 0;
}

```

When debugging, it is helpful to compile with additional debugging symbols and
information. `gcc` supports a [variety of
flags](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html) to produce
debugging information, but if using `gdb`, the `-ggdb` flag will produce debug
information specifically for `gdb`:

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -ggdb -static -o sum sum.c
```

We now have a `sum` binary, let's try and run it:

```
./sum
```

~~This should not work because our binary is compiled with a RISC-V target.~~
Oops! Looks like that worked? Did we use the wrong compiler? Let's check:

```

$ file sum
sum: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, UCB RISC-V, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped

```

We can see that `sum` is a 64-bit ELF binary compiled for RISC-V, so what's
going on here? Without knowing it, you may already have jumped ahead to our
emulation step. If you are running Linux, the kernel supports a [feature
called](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html)
`binfmt_misc`. This allows for an interpreter to be registered and invoked
automatically for a specified binary type. When we installed QEMU, it went ahead
and registered our user-mode emulators:

```

$ ls /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/
jar               qemu-aarch64      qemu-armeb        qemu-m68k         qemu-mips64       qemu-mipsn32      qemu-ppc64        qemu-riscv32      qemu-sh4          qemu-sparc32plus  qemu-xtensaeb
python2.7         qemu-alpha        qemu-cris         qemu-microblaze   qemu-mips64el     qemu-mipsn32el    qemu-ppc64abi32   qemu-riscv64      qemu-sh4eb        qemu-sparc64      register
python3.8         qemu-arm          qemu-hppa         qemu-mips         qemu-mipsel       qemu-ppc          qemu-ppc64le      qemu-s390x        qemu-sparc        qemu-xtensa       status

```

This is great! However, this isn't going to work when we are debugging, so we
need to run our RISC-V `gdb` while pointing at `qemu-riscv64`. First lets start
our debugging session:

```

$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb sum
(gdb) run
Don't know how to run.  Try "help target".
(gdb)

```

You'll notice that if we try to run, `gdb` will prompt us to add a
[target](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gdb/html_node/gdb_122.html). QEMU
supports the `gdbstub` remote connection protocol, and we can start a `gdb`
server in user-mode QEMU by passing `-g <port>`:

```
qemu-riscv64 -g 1234 sum
```

This will start QEMU, but wait for `gdb` to connect, which we can do by setting
a remote target:

```

(gdb) target remote :1234
Remote debugging using :1234
0x00000000000100c6 in _start ()
(gdb)

```

Let's verify our `main` function exists:

```

(gdb) disass main

Nice, now we are ready to get to work! So keep an eye out for the next post :)

## Closing Thoughts

I'm excited to get this series started. My goal is to peel back some of the
layers of abstraction that we commonly find ourselves interacting with on a
daily basis, while also demonstrating some of the components and design
decisions of RISC-V specifically that have a chance to make it the dominant ISA
of the future. If I can do a better job of helping us achieve that goal, or you
just have questions of comments, send me a message
