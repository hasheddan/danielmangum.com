I am excited to announce the launch of the [Research Triangle RISC-V Community
Group](https://community.riscv.org/research-triangle-risc-v-group/)!

As evidenced by my [recent
posts](https://danielmangum.com/categories/risc-v-bytes/) and [conference
talks](https://youtu.be/PJXywAi0DR0), I have been spending more and more time
learning and working in and around the RISC-V community. While there are
numerous commercial benefits of an open source instruction set architecture
(ISA), I am particularly excited about the opportunities it provides for folks
like myself who do not have formal training in processor design. Software that
interacts closely with hardware, such as compilers and embedded systems, has
long been accessible in an open source context, but RISC-V opens up the other
side of the interface. Speaking from my own experience, being able to see both
the software and hardware side has greatly accelerated my skills and
understanding. I hope that continuing to create more resources for learning and
advancement will allow others to have the same experience.

I recently moved to North Carolina and have been excited about some of the work
being done in the area related to RISC-V. If you are interested in attending,
assisting in organizing, or hosting events at your company or organization,
please feel free to reach out on Twitter at

Onwards towards a more open hardware future!
