I have been using
[Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) for
[`moss`](https://github.com/mosscomp) RTL development, which, despite its
notoriously large install size, offers a fairly decent developer experience.

However, I still prefer to write Verilog in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), as it
allows me to use vim motions, as well as switch between RTL and software code
without changing my workflow. For most languages, I leverage Neovim's [Language
Server Protocol (LSP)](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html) support for linting,
formatting, auto-completion, and compiler diagnostics. I had been missing the
same level of support for [Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog), but
noticed that [`nvim-lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) listed
a few different options. One of the most mature options is
[Verible](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible), which is developed under
the [CHIPS Alliance](https://www.chipsalliance.org/).

Setup is pretty straightforward and mirrors other language server
configurations. I still use an `init.vim` configuration script rather than
`init.lua`, but the setup looks largely the same.

`init.vim` (snippet)
```
lua <<EOF
require('lspconfig').verible.setup{
  cmd = {'verible-verilog-ls', '--rules_config_search'},
}
EOF

autocmd BufWritePost *.v lua vim.lsp.buf.format({ async = false })
```

[`verible-verilog-ls`](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible/tree/master/verilog/tools/ls)
is the language server component of the Verible tool suite. You can find
additional configuraion options in the
[Verible](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible/tree/master/verilog/tools/ls#neovim)
and
[`nvim-lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#verible)
documentation. The primary adjustments being made to the default setup are that
we are supplying a flag (`--rules_config_search`) and specifying that we want
formatting (`vim.lsp.buf.format`) to run automatically after saving Verilog
(`*.v`) files.

The next time I opened Neovim, I was able to auto-format all existing RTL files
on save. I also was presented with inline hints, such as the ones shown below.

> rules.

While this is helpful, Verible, as well as many of the other language server
options, is designed primarily for
[SystemVerilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog). Because
SystemVerilog is a superset of Verilog, many of the linter rules suggest changes
that are not valid in Verilog, such as the use of keywords like `always_comb`
(you can find a full list of linter rules
[here](https://chipsalliance.github.io/verible/verilog_lint.html#lint-rules)).
Given the sample size of the existing `moss` RTL, I was [able to put
together](https://github.com/mosscomp/moss/pull/49) a Verible linting
configuration that eliminated these issues.

`.rules.verible_lint`
```
parameter-name-style=localparam_style:ALL_CAPS
-always-comb
-explicit-parameter-storage-type
-unpacked-dimensions-range-ordering
```

Because we supplied the `--rules_config_search` flag, `verible-verilog-ls` will
automatically search for a rules file with name `.rules.verible_lint` in parent
directories and apply it to the current file. This is especially useful in the
case of our Neovim setup where the path to the rules file may differ between
projects, so supplying a path via `--rules_config <path>` in our config would be
brittle. Reopening Neovim revealed that the rules file was in fact being
honored.

> Note: you can test your linter rules config by invoking `verible-verilog-lint
> <path> --rules_config_search` directly.

I am sure that my setup will continue to evolve over time, but my development
workflow has already been significantly improved, despite still having to open
Vivado to run simulation, synthesis, and implementation (place & route). Given
that interfacing with Vivado can be done using [`tcl`
commands](https://www.tcl.tk/about/language.html), I am planning to move towards
not using the UI at all and triggering all workflows from Neovim. Coming to
logic design from a software engineering background, I believe that I have a
unique opportunity to push forward improved developer experience in the space.
Documenting how to leverage some of the awesome existing open source tooling is
a small, but important first step, and I'll make sure to continue to write posts
as my workflow evolves over time!
