Nordic Semiconductor recently made their new IoT prototyping platform, the
[Thingy:91
X](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-91-X/GetStarted),
generally available. The Thingy:91 X is an upgrade to their existing prototyping
platform, the
[Thingy:91](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-91),
replacing the [nRF9160](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF9160)
System-in-Package (SiP) with an
[nRF9151](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF9151) SiP, the
[nRF52840](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF52840) System-on-Chip (SoC)
with an [nRF5340](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF5340) SoC, and adding
the [nRF7002](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF7002) integrated circuit
(IC). Each of these components enables a different type of connectivity:

- nRF9151: cellular ([LTE-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE-M) /
  [NB-IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband_IoT)), [DECT
  NR+](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Wireless/DECT-NR),
  [GNSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation)
- nRF5340: [Bluetooth LE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy),
  [802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4), and more
- nRF7002: [Wi-Fi 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6)

This combination of protocols enables a ton of interesting applications.
However, working with the Thingy:91 X can be a bit more cumbersome than with one
of Nordic’s more focused development kits (DKs), many of which include a [SEGGER
J-Link
OB](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-ob/) debug
probe for on-board programming and debugging. In fact, many of the Nordic DKs
can be used to program the Thingy:91 X by attaching the DK OB’s
[10-pin](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101416/0100/Hardware-Description/Target-Interfaces/Cortex-Debug--10-pin-)
debug out port to the Thingy:91 X’s 10-pin debug header. Typically, a
stand-alone probe, such as the [J-Link
BASE](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-base/),
is used.

This allows for programming both the nRF9151 and nRF5340, with the selected
target controlled by the position of `SW2`. However, on DKs the OB (referred to
as the “interface MCU” in documentation) is also responsible for exposing
[UARTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter)
to a USB host as [CDC
ACM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_communications_device_class) devices such
that they can be accessed as serial ports. Because there is no OB on the
Thingy:91 X, the nRF5340 handles exposing UARTs to the host via the USB-C
connector.

This difference can be observed in the block diagrams. For example, the [nRF9160
DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF9160-DK) [shows
the
connection](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ug_nrf9160_dk/page/UG/nrf91_DK/hw_description/hw_block_diagram.html)
from the interface MCU to UARTs on the nRF9160 and nRF52840.

On the Thingy:91 X, the USB-C connector is wired to the nRF5340.

{{< center-img src="../../static/thingy91x_usb_uart_1.png" alt="thingy91x-usb-uart-1" >}}

Naturally, the nRF5340 needs to be programmed with firmware that handles
exposing the UARTs. Nordic provides an application, [connectivity
bridge](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/applications/connectivity_bridge/README.html),
that [offers this
functionality](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/05b9d9e0086ba57b92ae817632a41265b8bcabc4/applications/connectivity_bridge/src/modules).
If you plug your Thingy:91 X into your host machine, do not see two serial ports
appear, and do not see any devices [listed with `nrfutil device
list`](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/nrfutil-device/guides/programming.html),
it is likely that the nRF5340 is not programmed with the connectivity bridge
firmware. This can be confusing if you are programming the nRF5340 via a debug
probe like the OB, don’t realize that it is handling exposing the serial ports,
and suddenly the device no longer appears. While this could happen on a DK as
well if you were able to corrupt the J-Link OB firmware, it is less likely given
that programming new firmware on the OB is typically not part of the development
process.

If you need to access serial ports and have changed the firmware on the nRF5340,
the issue can easily be addressed by building and flashing the connectivity
bridge again.

To build the firmware, navigate to `applications/connectivity_bridge` in the
[nRF Connect SDK](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf), and use
[`west`](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/index.html) with the
`thingy91x/nrf5340/cpuapp` target.

```console
$ west build -p -b thingy91x/nrf5340/cpuapp .
```

With the Thingy:91 X connected via a debug probe, power on, and `SW2` targeting
nRF53, the firmware can be programmed onto the application core of the nRF5340.

```console
$ west flash --recover
```

After reboot, the device should show up with `nrfutil` and the serial ports
should be accessible.

```console
$ nrfutil device list
THINGY91X_{serial_no}
