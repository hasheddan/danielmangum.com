Kubernetes is comprised of a [variety of
components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/), yet most
end-user interaction with the system flows through the [API
Server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/).
It is the entrypoint to many of the features that the project has built up over
its lifetime, and [can be
extended](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/) to support
arbitrary additional functionality. Because of this, the API Server has [proved
to be a
bottleneck](https://blog.upbound.io/scaling-kubernetes-to-thousands-of-crds/) in
some cases that it was not originally designed to accommodate, or at least
accommodate well.

Much of the time when the Kubernetes API Server is not behaving as we expect,
especially when it comes to performance, understanding why the system is
exhibiting undesirable behavior can be challenging. Though we have access to the
source code of the project, navigating it and determining which code paths are
being exercised may not be straightforward. Like most complex systems, breaking
the code down into smaller components, then building them back up to form the
complete picture helps us not only be able to pinpoint where the system is
failing much quicker, but also allows us to modify and substitute components to
fit our use case.

In this new series, _Kubernetes API Server Adventures_ ("k8s ASA"), we'll dive
into all parts of the API Server, gaining an understanding of how they work, and
what other components they interact with. Along the way we'll experiment with
substituting our own components, building tooling, and [looking
at](https://github.com/crdsdev/kindred) how [other
folks](https://github.com/thetirefire/badidea) have [modified
it](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp) to fit their use cases. Who knows, we might
even build our own. ðŸ‘€
