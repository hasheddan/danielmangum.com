The [ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3) is a popular
microcontroller (MCU) for a variety of reasons, such as its [support for
external pseudostatic RAM
(PSRAM)](https://danielmangum.com/posts/static-alloc-external-ram-esp32/). One
of its lesser known features is its [Universal Serial Bus
(USB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB) [On-The-Go
(OTG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go) controller.

> The previously released
> [ESP32-S2](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2), as well as
> the new [ESP32-P4](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-p4), also
> have USB OTG support, with the latter having two controllers.

USB OTG devices can act as a device or as a host. This is a popular feature for
smartphones, which, when attached to a laptop or desktop should act as a device,
but may want to act as a host for some peripherals, such as a keyboard, that may
be attached to it. The same can be true for a microcontroller, which may be
programmed or debugged as a USB device, but may want to act as a host during
normal operation.

Espressif's [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) includes a [USB Host
Library](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.2.3/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/usb_host.html),
which can configure the USB controller to act as an OTG host, then exposes
operations via higher level APIs. Though Espressif doesn't document it anywhere,
looking through the USB device and host driver implementations reveals that the
ESP32-S3 uses the popular [Synopsys DesignWare Core (DWC2) USB 2.0 OTG
Controller](https://www.synopsys.com/dw/ipdir.php?ds=dwc_usb_2_0_hs_otg), which
is also used by [STM32
MCUs](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors.html) and many
others. Most of the configuration of the controller has to be reverse engineered
because Synopsys does not publish documentation on its cores, nor does it allow
for manufacturers to do so. The [ESP32-S3 Technical Reference
Manual](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_technical_reference_manual_en.pdf)
only says the following in USB OTG controller register documentation (section
32.5):

> The catalog and comprehensive specifications of USB OTG registers are subject
> to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) as mandated by the IP provider.

The USB host stack is composed of the following layers, which ultimately are
accessed via abstractions offered by the Host Library.
- USB PHY
- USB Host Controller Driver (HCD)
- USB Host Driver (USBH)
- USB Enumeration Driver
- USB Hub Driver

These layers are configured on a call to
[`usb_host_install()`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/ce6085349f8d5a95fc857e28e2d73d73dd3629b5/components/usb/usb_host.c#L438).
While there are a number of steps required for configuration, the most pertitent
to enabling OTG host functionality is setting the proper signals in the USB PHY.
In
[`usb_phy_new()`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/ce6085349f8d5a95fc857e28e2d73d73dd3629b5/components/usb/usb_phy.c#L275),
the call to
[`usb_phy_otg_set_mode()`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/ce6085349f8d5a95fc857e28e2d73d73dd3629b5/components/usb/usb_phy.c#L122)
configures the PHY in host or device mode by connecting the proper peripheral
signals to logical 0 (`GPIO_MATRIX_CONST_ZERO_INPUT`) or 1
(`GPIO_MATRIX_CONST_ONE_INPUT`).

```c
    if (mode == USB_OTG_MODE_HOST) {
        esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(GPIO_MATRIX_CONST_ZERO_INPUT, USB_OTG_IDDIG_IN_IDX, false);     // connected connector is A side
        esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(GPIO_MATRIX_CONST_ZERO_INPUT, USB_SRP_BVALID_IN_IDX, false);
        esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(GPIO_MATRIX_CONST_ONE_INPUT, USB_OTG_VBUSVALID_IN_IDX, false);  // receiving a valid Vbus from host
        esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(GPIO_MATRIX_CONST_ONE_INPUT, USB_OTG_AVALID_IN_IDX, false);     // HIGH to force USB host mode
        if (handle->target == USB_PHY_TARGET_INT) {
            // Configure pull resistors for host
            usb_wrap_pull_override_vals_t vals = {
                .dp_pu = false,
                .dm_pu = false,
                .dp_pd = true,
                .dm_pd = true,
            };
            usb_wrap_hal_phy_enable_pull_override(&handle->wrap_hal, &vals);
        }
    } else if (mode == USB_OTG_MODE_DEVICE) {
        esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(GPIO_MATRIX_CONST_ONE_INPUT, USB_OTG_IDDIG_IN_IDX, false);      // connected connector is mini-B side
        esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(GPIO_MATRIX_CONST_ONE_INPUT, USB_SRP_BVALID_IN_IDX, false);     // HIGH to force USB device mode
        esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(GPIO_MATRIX_CONST_ONE_INPUT, USB_OTG_VBUSVALID_IN_IDX, false);  // receiving a valid Vbus from device
        esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(GPIO_MATRIX_CONST_ZERO_INPUT, USB_OTG_AVALID_IN_IDX, false);
    }
```

After installation of the host library,
[`usb_host_lib_handle_events()`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/ce6085349f8d5a95fc857e28e2d73d73dd3629b5/components/usb/usb_host.c#L624)
must be called in a loop to process USB host administrative events. Actual
interaction with devices is handled by
[clients](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/usb_host.html#clients),
which are registered by calling
[`usb_host_client_register()`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/ce6085349f8d5a95fc857e28e2d73d73dd3629b5/components/usb/usb_host.c#L771).
The [esp-usb](https://github.com/espressif/esp-usb) project includes [a number
of client
implementations](https://github.com/espressif/esp-usb/tree/3aa598dcd98eff4334c289b477f46af939e2ffb2/host/class)
(i.e. "device class drivers") for different device classes, but there is also [a
helpful
example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/peripherals/usb/host/usb_host_lib)
of installing a custom client, which only prints device information.

In order to run this example, we need to be able to connect devices to an
ESP32-S3's USB OTG peripheral. The ESP32-S3's USB data lines are connected to
fixed GPIO pins 19 (D-) and 20 (D+). Fortunately, on the
[ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32s3/esp32-s3-devkitc-1/user_guide_v1.0.html),
these pins are wired to an onboard Micro-USB connector.

{{< center-img src="../../static/esp32s3_otg_2.png" alt="esp32s3-otg-2" >}}

However, to connect a USB device to the DevKitC, we'll need an OTG cable, such
as a Micro-USB to Micro-USB, or an OTG adapter. I purchased a [small adapter
from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRP9FPJQ) that has a nice feature of
supporting Micro-USB to USB-A or USB-C to USB-A. Because the DevKitC also
includes a [Silicon Labs CP210x USB-to-UART
bridge](https://www.silabs.com/interface/usb-bridges/usbxpress/device.cp2102n-gqfn20?tab=specs)
that is accessible via a separate Micro-USB port, we can power, program, and
monitor the output of the ESP32-S3 while its USB peripheral is connected to
another device.

I happened to have a second DevKitC on hand, which served as a useful target
because it could also be powered, programmed, and monitored via its UART-to-USB
port, while being connected as a device to the first DevKitC via its USB
peripheral port. The full setup looks as follows, with the device on the left
serving as a USB OTG host, and the device on the right running a simple hello
world program and serving as a USB OTG device.

{{< center-img src="../../static/esp32s3_otg_0.jpg" alt="esp32s3-otg-0" >}}

| **ESP32-S3-DevKitC** | **USB-to-UART Port** | **USB OTG Port**                    |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **OTG Host**         | Connected to Laptop  | Connected to OTG Device via Adapter |
| **OTG Device**       | Connected to Laptop  | Connected to OTG Host via Adapter   |

With both kits connected to a laptop as serial devices, we can monitor the
output of each (Host: `ttyUSB0`, Device: `ttyUSB1`).

```

After registering the custom USB Host Library client on the first DevKitC, we
can see that it is able to successfully fetch device, configuration, interface,
and endpoint descriptors, as well as string descriptors for manufacturer,
product, and serial number, from the second DevKitC.

I wanted to test this out with some other devices, and being a big fan of
Raspberry Pi's MCUs, I always have a few
[Pico's](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html)
around the office. I still had one programmed with
[picoprobe](https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe) from [my
post](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-accessing-pinecil-uart-picoprobe/)
about accessing the
[Pinecil](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/)
UART. I used a second Pico to power the first by connecting the second to the
laptop, then connecting its VBUS (pin 40) and GND (pin 38) to the VBUS and GND
on the first. I then connected the first to the OTG host DevKitC.

{{< center-img src="../../static/esp32s3_otg_1.jpg" alt="esp32s3-otg-1" >}}

Sure enough, the USB Host Library client was able to fetch the same information
from the Pico, identifying it as a `Picoprobe (CMSIS-DAP)`.

Using a microcontroller to obtain information about USB devices is interesting,
but there is much more that can be accomplished when we go beyond simple control
transfers. In future posts, we'll dive deeper into the USB hardware and software
stack, and examine what capabilities are offered by different types of devices.
