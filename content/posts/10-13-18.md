Docker containers are widely used for developing and running anything from web applications to redis caches. However, they can also be useful for running what can effectively be a light VM (a container operates very differently from a VM, but we are just talking about the usecase). I like to use a container for accessing the the Linux command line. However, many users do not know how to run a container in the background and access the shell. Here is a simple way to do so, with a very [minimal Ubuntu container](https://gist.github.com/HashedDan/2d1859904c1767fa7682e2fbe7ac0eb2):

- Create a directory and a Dockerfile inside. Use the linked Dockerfule above for a minimal Ubuntu configuration.
- Build the container with your desired image name:
```docker build -t <image_name> .```
- Run the container in the background: ```docker run -t -d <image_name>```
- Identify container name: ```docker container ls```
- Connect to the Linux shell in the container: ```docker exec -i -t <container_name> /bin/bash```
- When done, kill the background container process: ```docker kill <container_name>```
