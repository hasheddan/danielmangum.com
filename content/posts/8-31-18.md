Two of the most prominent sorting algorithms used in computer programming are *merge sort* and *quick sort*. While the performance appears to be rather similar for these alogrithms, there are specific scenarios in which one is superior to the other.

Before we examine these cases, let's look at hour each algorithm works.

### Merge Sort

The basic premise behind merge sort is taking a data structure (usually an array) and dividing it down into the smallest possible units of that type of data structure.

For instance, if using an array of length 8, merge sort would first break that array down into 8 arrays of length 1, before then merging them together in an ordered manner.

To accomplish this, merge sort uses the concept of recursion.

## Quick Sort

Quick sort also uses recursion, but instead of dividing into new arrays, it does its sorting in-place (we will come back to this when talking about space complexity).

# Run Time Complexity

The most commonly referenced metric when evaluating algorithms (and for good reason) is the run time. Usually you evaluate the best, worst, and average case for the run time.

Both of the algorithms we are discussing today are excellent (relative to other sorting algorithms) in terms of run time. This is one of the major reasons they are so widely employed. However, we will see that though they have the same average run time, one can be more performant than the other depending on the scenario.

At their average case, both algorithms are ```O(n log n)```. However, quick sort in a rare worst case, can have performance of ```O(n^2)```. Let's look at when this occurs.
