Having a good debugging workflow is critical to developing software quickly with
high confidence. Fortunately, writing software for computers is often done,
well, on a computer, meaning that while writing programs we can run other
programs that help us understand the behavior of what we are writing. Typically
the machine we are writing software for, though it may run in a data center and
have a different form factor, doesn't look so different from the machine we are
writing it on. My [System76](https://system76.com/) laptop is not the same as
the servers racked in [US East
1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html),
but it is a close enough approximation.

However, when writing embedded software, the target machine looks quite
different than the machine that the software is developed on, and it is
frequently significantly more resource constrained. One option is to run an
emulator, such as [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), on the host machine and connect your debugger. This
is the strategy we have used in previous [RISC-V Bytes
posts](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-qemu-gdb/), and the built-in
[gdbstub](https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/gdbstub) functionality makes connecting
[gdb](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) straightforward.

There is nothing like the real hardware though, and many systems allow for
debugging the software running on a device by communicating over
[JTAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG) from the host machine. Some even
provide built-in USB-to-JTAG circuitry, absolving developers of the need to use
additional adapters. The drawback of using real hardware is that simulating
certain input and output to a program can be difficult. Furthermore, if testing against a
single component of a larger system, the components providing input and output
may not be available at the time of writing software.

To improve the development experience in these scenarios, some chips implement
[semihosting](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0471/g/Bgbjjgij), which
can greatly enhance an embedded development workflow by allowing a program
running on a device to perform operations on the host.

## Overview of Semihosting

As we have explored in many posts in the RISC-V Bytes series, computer programs
are just a sequence of binary instructions that a CPU has been designed to
interpret in a specific manner. When writing software on a host machine, then
running it under a debugger, the debugger typically controls the child program
using functionality exposed by the operating system, such as
[`ptrace(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html) on Linux.
This allows the debugger to selectively feed instructions from the child program
to the CPU, optionally injecting additional instructions or performing some
computation between issuing subsequent instructions.

When working with an embedded device, there are two systems at play: the host
and the device. This complicates the architecture, but similar functionality can
be accomplished, typically using interfaces such as the aforementioned JTAG or
[ARM Serial Wire Debug
(SWD)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0031/a/The-Serial-Wire-Debug-Port--SW-DP-/Introduction-to-the-ARM-Serial-Wire-Debug--SWD--protocol).

These interfaces are quite different, but both enable communication with a
processor running on a device. However, the processor itself must offer
debugging functionality, much like it supports executing instructions defined by
its instruction set architecture (ISA). RISC-V has a dedicated [debugging
specification](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-debug-spec/blob/master/riscv-debug-stable.pdf),
which defines how a system can expose hardware debugging support both internally
and externally.

When using an external system (i.e. host) for debugging, communication with
RISC-V hardware debugging components happens over the **Debug Transport Module
(DTM)**. As shown in the diagram below, there could be multiple transports used
to implement a DTM, but the specification only defines one for JTAG at this
point in time.

{{< center-img src="../../static/risc_v_semihost_0.png" alt="risc-v-semihosting-0" >}}

> Diagram showing optional and required components in the RISC-V debug
> specification.

When being controlled by an external debugger, a RISC-V hart is said to be in
**Debug Mode (D)**, which can be considered an additional [privilege
level](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-privilege-levels/). When
implemented, this is the maximum privilege level, as it provides even lower
level access than **Machine Mode (M)**. While the the debug specification
details a variety of required and optional functionality, the [privileged and
unprivileged specifications](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/) define
the `EBREAK` instruction, which is similar to the `ECALL` instruction we have
used in previous posts to perform system calls and trap to higher privilege
levels. The `EBREAK` instruction instead will transfer control to the debugging
environment, effectively implementing a [software
breakpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint). This type of breakpoint
is interesting because, unlike triggers and hardware breakpoints where the
debugger is forcing the program to halt, software breakpoints, though they may
be inserted by the debugger, are the program "asking to be halted".

While the typical purpose of this behavior is to allow for examining state at
the breakpoint, it can be thought of as a general purpose communication channel.
That is, the program can form a "request" in its state, issue an `EBREAK`, then
read a "response" from the debugger that has been written in the program state.
This is the basic idea behind semihosting.

Fortunately for existing debugging software, RISC-V opted to use a very similar
implementation for semihosting as the one initially defined for ARM processors.
The unofficial [semihosting
specification](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-semihosting/blob/main/riscv-semihosting-spec.adoc)
defines the following sequence of instructions for a program to indicate to a
debugger that the encountered breakpoint is a semihosting request.

```
slli x0, x0, 0x1f       # 0x01f01013    Entry NOP
ebreak                  # 0x00100073    Break to debugger
srai x0, x0, 7          # 0x40705013    NOP encoding the semihosting call number 7
```

On both 32-bit and 64-bit harts, the `a0` register is used to specify the type
of
[operation](https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/main/semihosting/semihosting.rst#semihosting-operations)
being requested, and `a1` is used to supply parameters. `a0` is used to supply
responses. Depending on the type of operation, the request parameter in `a1` or
the response in `a0` may be either a value or a memory address of the data
block. In this manner, arbitrary data may be transferred between host and
device.

## Zephyr Semihosting Support

In the last few posts, we've explored the [Zephyr
RTOS](https://www.zephyrproject.org/). Zephyr conveniently offers support for
semihosting on ARM and RISC-V targets using a generic interface, which we'll use
in this post to communicate with an [Espressif
ESP32-C3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c3). The ESP32-C3
implements the RISC-V debug specification, and the DevKitC-02 has built-in
USB-to-JTAG circuitry, meaning that we can connect gdb on our host machine to
the hart on the device using OpenOCD (more on this in a bit).

The Zephyr semihosting interface is defined in `semihost.h`, where operation
enums are defined, as well as signatures for a few common operations. A codensed
representation is provided below.

`include/zephyr/arch/common/semihost.h` ([ref](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/4babd545cc1b1ddef190aaedeabd1c3db3fbb8a2/include/zephyr/arch/common/semihost.h))
```c
long semihost_exec(enum semihost_instr instr, void *args);
char semihost_poll_in(void);
void semihost_poll_out(char c);
long semihost_open(const char *path, long mode);
long semihost_close(long fd);
long semihost_flen(long fd);
long semihost_seek(long fd, long offset);
long semihost_read(long fd, void *buf, long len);
long semihost_write(long fd, const void *buf, long len);
```

In reality, all functions listed are just helpful wrappers around
`semihost_exec`, meaning that they can all be implemented generically, while
`semihost_exec` must be defined for each architecture. For example, the
implementation of `semihost_close` looks as follows.

`arch/common/semihost.c` ([ref](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/4babd545cc1b1ddef190aaedeabd1c3db3fbb8a2/arch/common/semihost.c#L73))
```c
long semihost_close(long fd)
{
	struct semihost_close_args args = {
		.fd = fd
	};

	return semihost_exec(SEMIHOST_CLOSE, &args);
}
```

The corresponding `semihost_exec` implementation for RISC-V mirrors what we
previously saw in the unofficial specification, written in C with inline
assembly.

`arch/riscv/core/semihost.c` ([ref](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/4babd545cc1b1ddef190aaedeabd1c3db3fbb8a2/arch/riscv/core/semihost.c#L21))
```c
/*
 * QEMU requires that the semihosting trap instruction sequence, consisting of
 * three uncompressed instructions, lie in the same page, and refuses to
 * interpret the trap sequence if these instructions are placed across two
 * different pages.
 *
 * The `semihost_exec` function, which occupies 12 bytes, is aligned at a
 * 16-byte boundary to ensure that the three trap sequence instructions are
 * never placed across two different pages.
 */
long __aligned(16) semihost_exec(enum semihost_instr instr, void *args)
{
	register unsigned long a0 __asm__ ("a0") = instr;
	register void *a1 __asm__ ("a1") = args;
	register long ret __asm__ ("a0");

	__asm__ volatile (
		".option push\n\t"
		".option norvc\n\t"
		"slli zero, zero, 0x1f\n\t"
		"ebreak\n\t"
		"srai zero, zero, 0x7\n\t"
		".option pop"
		: "=r" (ret) : "r" (a0), "r" (a1) : "memory");

	return ret;
}
```

## Debugger Setup

While the ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 does have built-in USB-to-JTAG support, it cannot
be accessed over the built-in Micro-USB port. Instead, a dual-channel USB
interface is available on the GPIO18 (`D-`) and GPIO19 (`D+`) pins, meaning that
a single connection can be used to simultaneously provide USB terminal and JTAG
access. I unfortunately did not have a USB breakout cable on hand, so I had to
pull out the wire cutters / strippers.

![risc-v-semihosting-1](../../static/risc_v_semihost_1.jpg)

> Picture of my heinous wire-stripping job.

After exposing the wires, I used female-to-male jumpers to connect `D-`, `D+`,
`5V`, and `GND` to a breadboard where I had placed the development kit. I
plugged it into my host and saw signs of life!

![risc-v-semihosting-2](../../static/risc_v_semihost_2.jpg)

There is an excellent [JTAG debugging
guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/api-guides/jtag-debugging/)
hidden in the the ESP32-C3 documentation that explains setup, but if you
followed along with the previous [Exploring a Custom ESP32
Bootloader](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-exploring-custom-esp32-bootloader/)
and [Zephyr on the
ESP32](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-zephyr-on-esp32/) posts, you
should already have all of your Espressif and Zephyr tools installed.

```
$ ls ~/.espressif/
dist  espidf.constraints.v5.1.txt  idf-env.json  python_env  tools
$ ls ~/.local/zephyr-sdk-0.16.0/
arm-zephyr-eabi  cmake  environment-setup-x86_64-pokysdk-linux  riscv64-zephyr-elf  sdk_toolchains  sdk_version  setup.sh  sysroots  version-x86_64-pokysdk-linux  zephyr-sdk-x86_64-hosttools-standalone-0.9.sh
```

With the USB cable connected to the host machine, we should be able to find the device.

```
$ lsusb | grep Espressif
Bus 002 Device 008: ID 303a:1001 Espressif USB JTAG/serial debug unit
```

One tool we haven't used in previous posts is [Open On-Chip Debugger
(OpenOCD)](https://openocd.org/doc-release/html/About.html#What-is-OpenOCD_003f).
OpenOCD is both magical and maddening. It is magical in that it enables
communicating with a wide variety of hardware, and maddening in that vendors
will frequently fork the project and deliver custom distributions, meaning the
you'll quickly find yourself with many builds of the tool on your local machine.
Espressif follows this pattern by providing [their own OpenOCD
build](https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32), which is included in the
previously acquired tooling.

OpenOCD is intended to be configuration driven, and there are [three types of
configuration
files](https://openocd.org/doc-release/html/OpenOCD-Project-Setup.html#User-Config-Files)
that inform how the software will talk with a device: **board**, **interface**,
and **target**. The relevant configuration for the ESP32-C3 can be found in the
OpenOCD `scripts` directory. The one we will actually reference is the board
file.

`~/.espressif/tools/openocd-esp32/v0.12.0-esp32-20230313/openocd-esp32/share/openocd/scripts/board/esp32c3-builtin.cfg`
```
# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later
#
# Example OpenOCD configuration file for ESP32-C3 connected via builtin USB-JTAG adapter.
#
# For example, OpenOCD can be started for ESP32-C3 debugging on
#
#   openocd -f board/esp32c3-builtin.cfg
#

# Source the JTAG interface configuration file
source [find interface/esp_usb_jtag.cfg]
# Source the ESP32-C3 configuration file
source [find target/esp32c3.cfg]
```

For the ESP32-C3 "built-in", the board file simply references the interface, which is USB /
JTAG, and the chip, which is the ESP32-C3. The interface file is relatively
uninteresting, though you will notice it matches our `lsusb` output above.

`~/.espressif/tools/openocd-esp32/v0.12.0-esp32-20230313/openocd-esp32/share/openocd/scripts/interface/esp_usb_jtag.cfg`
```

espusbjtag vid_pid 0x303a 0x1001
espusbjtag caps_descriptor 0x2000

#max speed

```

The target file, on the other hand, provides extensive information about how the
debug functionality works, and provides configuration to make gdb work properly.
We don't break down all parts in-depth in this post, but we'll explore more
about how OpenOCD works in the future.

We can now connect gdb to port `3333`, just as we did when [working with
QEMU](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-qemu-gdb/). However, before
doing so, we need to write some software to debug!

## Writing to the Host Filesystem

Our Zephyr semihosting project will look similar to the ["Hello, RISC-V Bytes!"
example](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-zephyr-on-esp32/#building-the-image),
but this time instead of printing to the UART console, we'll write to a file on
the host system.

`zephyr-riscv-semihosting`
```
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── gdbinit
├── prj.conf
├── src
│   └── main.c
```

The new files are `prj.conf` and `gdbinit`. The former is used to [enable
semihosting
support](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/kconfig.html#CONFIG_SEMIHOST),
which is disabled by default for the EPS32-C3 in Zephyr.

`prj.conf`
```
CONFIG_SEMIHOST=y
```

`gdbinit` is a set of startup commands provided by Espressif that makes getting
started debugging easier. It first connects to OpenOCD's gdbserver, then
performs some configuration before instructing OpenOCD to reset the hart and
immediately halt startup (`mon reset halt`). After flushing registers, the `thb`
command is used to set a temporary hardware breakpoint at `main`, meaning that
the first time we encounter `main` an exception should be triggered, then that
hardware breakpoint should be discarded. Lastly, the `c` command is used to
continue util we hit that hardware breakpoint.

`gdbinit`
```
target remote :3333
set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 2
mon reset halt
flushregs
thb main
c
```

The only change in `CMakeLists` is the name of the project.
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0)

find_package(Zephyr 3.3.0 REQUIRED)
project(zephyr-riscv-semihosting)

target_sources(app PRIVATE src/main.c)
```

The program itself is a fairly minimal adaptation of the example from the
[Zephyr semihosting

and likely looks familiar to basic file input / ouput code you may have written
before. We start by opening a file for writing text (`SEMIHOST_OPEN_WT`), write
the contents of our buffer, then close the file.

`main.c`
```c
#include <zephyr/arch/common/semihost.h>
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>

int main(void) {
  const char *path = "./semihost.txt";
  long fd, write;
  uint8_t buffer[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'R', 'I', 'S', 'C',
                      '-', 'V', ' ', 'B', 'y', 't', 'e', 's', '!', '\n'};

  fd = semihost_open(path, SEMIHOST_OPEN_WB);
  if (fd < 0) {
    return -ENOENT;
  }
  write = semihost_write(fd, buffer, 21);
  if (write < 0) {
    return -ENOENT;
  }
  semihost_close(fd);
  return 0;
}
```

Now we can build the project using `west` as we have done in the past.

With the software running on the board, we can connect gdb to OpenOCD by passing
the `gdbinit` script and specifying the ELF file to get debugging symbols.

Error: Don't have the number of threads in FreeRTOS!
```

Just like when we are debugging locally, we are able to step through the
program. Stepping twice will move us past the initial file open operation.

> Note: you may see a `Don't have the number of threads in FreeRTOS!` warning
> emitted from gdb. These can safely be ignored for our scenario.

```
(gdb) n
Note: automatically using hardware breakpoints for read-only addresses.
10	  fd = semihost_open(path, SEMIHOST_OPEN_WB);
(gdb) n
11	  if (fd < 0) {
```

At this point, we have already exercised semihosting once, and we should be able
to see the `semihost.txt` file on the host in the same directory where gdb is
running, though the contents should be empty.

```
$ ls -la semihost.txt 
-rw-r--r-- 1 hasheddan hasheddan 0 May 29 17:55 semihost.txt
```

To see the instructions that were executed and resulted in the creation of
`semihost.txt`, we can instruct gdb to disassemble the function.

```
(gdb) disass semihost_open
Dump of assembler code for function semihost_open:

   0x420100d8 <+48>:	ret
End of assembler dump.
```

After the prologue, the address of the data block for the path and mode
parameters is stored in `a1`, while the `li a0,1` sets the operation to be
performed to
[`SEMIHOST_OPEN`](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/5f5b34793dc89a3ee5a33c566333760323e57fa0/include/zephyr/arch/common/semihost.h#L32).
Execution then jumps to to `semihost_exec`, where the actual semihosting
instruction sequence is performed.

```
(gdb) disass semihost_exec
Dump of assembler code for function semihost_exec:
   0x42010020 <+0>:	    slli	zero,zero,0x1f

   0x42010028 <+8>:	    srai	zero,zero,0x7
   0x4201002c <+12>:	ret
End of assembler dump.
```

The following semihosting operations follow the same pattern. If we continue,
the write and file close will be executed and `main` will return, causing the
program to sit in the idle thread.

```
(gdb) c
Continuing.
^C

27	}
```

Now if we examine the contents of `semihost.txt`, we should see our message!

```
$ cat semihost.txt 
Hello, RISC-V Bytes!
```

## Concluding Thoughts

We have only scratched the surface of cases where semihosting can be useful when
working with embedded systems. For example, Zephyr supports using semihosting as
a [console
driver](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/5f5b34793dc89a3ee5a33c566333760323e57fa0/drivers/console/semihost_console.c).
However, with knowledge of its general purpose input / output capabilities, we
can start to utilize it as a tool across projects.

As always, these posts are meant to serve as a useful resource for folks who are
interested in learning more about RISC-V and low-level software in general. If I
can do a better job of reaching that goal, or you have any questions or
comments, please feel free to send me a message
