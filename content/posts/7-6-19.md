If you follow me anywhere on the internet, you likely have seen me mention Crossplane (probably more times than you would like). I recently went back to the city I grew up in and my mom asked me what I was working on these days. She has limited technical knowledge when it comes to computers, but understands from an end-user perspective. When explaining any concept, it is useful to meet the audience where they are. One of Crossplane's most important features is the separation of concern it provides between administrators and developers.
