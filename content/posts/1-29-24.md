In the [most recent Pinecil
post](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-soldering-pinecil-breakout-board/),
we walked through how to solder the header pins on the Pinecil [breakout
board](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-break-out-board/). With the headers
attached, we can now communicate with the Pinecil's microcontroller via a number
of protocols. Today we are going to focus on accessing the Universal
Asynchronous Receiver / Transmitter (UART) hardware in order to receive serial
data from the microcontroller, such as log messages, on a development machine
(e.g. laptop).

However, though the breakout board does allow us to access the UART pins, it is
likely that your development machine does not expose its own UART interface.
Instead, most machines are equipped with more commonly used ports for
peripherals, such as [Universal Serial Bus
(USB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB). In order to communicate between the
Pinecil microcontroller and the development machine, we'll need some sort of
bridge. While there is plenty of dedicated hardware that can be purchased for a
few dollars, such as this [USB to serial
converter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5335), I have been leveraging my
small collection of [Raspberry Pi
Pico's](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html)
for tasks such as this since [attending Hackaday Supercon
2023](https://danielmangum.com/posts/supercon-2023-day-1/) and [hacking on the
conference badge](https://danielmangum.com/posts/supercon-2023-day-2/), which
included a Pico [on the back of the
PCB](https://hackaday.com/2023/10/18/2023-hackaday-supercon-badge-welcome-to-the-vectorscope/#under-the-hood).

The Pico is the first Raspberry Pi product to use in-house silicon,
incorporating the [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/), a
microcontroller with dual ARM
[Cortex-M0+](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Cortex-M0-Plus) processors,
and a highly flexible [programmable input / output
(PIO)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/what-is-pio/) system. The "downside" of
using a general purpose microcontroller, rather than dedicated hardware, for our
USB-UART bridge is that we'll need to write or obtain firmware that performs the
desired functionality.

Fortunately, Raspbery Pi explicitly encourages using the Pico for this type of
use case.

## Building the Pico Firmware

Appendix A of the [Pico Getting Started
Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)
introduces the use of the Pico as a programming and debugging device. To support
this scenario, they have supplied open source firmware, appropriately [named
`picoprobe`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe), that is built on
[FreeRTOS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel) and the [Pico C/C++
SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).

While the guide primarily describes its use when working with a second Pico,
`picoprobe` can be useful with any other device that exposes UART pins or a
[Serial Wire Debug
(SWD)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0031/a/The-Serial-Wire-Debug-Port--SW-DP-/Introduction-to-the-ARM-Serial-Wire-Debug--SWD--protocol)
port. Raspberry Pi also offers a [debug
probe](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/debug-probe/), which is essentially
a Pico with `picoprobe` pre-programmed on the RP2040, and dedicated ports and
connectors for UART and SWD.

`picoprobe` is configured using a header file, which is then included [in
`src/picoprobe_config.h`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe/blob/721b69cf5c8535e57995dbdd2e74f1bbc2f36944/src/picoprobe_config.h#L68).
There are two built-in configurations, one for the
[Pico](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe/blob/721b69cf5c8535e57995dbdd2e74f1bbc2f36944/include/board_pico_config.h)
and one for the [debug
probe](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe/blob/721b69cf5c8535e57995dbdd2e74f1bbc2f36944/include/board_debugprobe_config.h).
We can use the Pico configuration, and because it is the default, the following
steps can be used to build `picoprobe` without any updates.

1. Ensure all submodules are up to date.

```shell
$ git submodule update --init
Submodule 'CMSIS_5' (https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5) registered for path 'CMSIS_5'
Submodule 'freertos' (https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel) registered for path 'freertos'
Cloning into '/home/hasheddan/code/github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe/CMSIS_5'...
Cloning into '/home/hasheddan/code/github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe/freertos'...
Submodule path 'CMSIS_5': checked out 'a65b7c9a3e6502127fdb80eb288d8cbdf251a6f4'
Submodule path 'freertos': checked out '2dfdfc4ba4d8bb487c8ea6b5428d7d742ce162b8'
```

2. Create a build directory and enter it.

```shell
$ mkdir build && cd "$_"
```

3. Generate build files with `cmake`, specifying that the Pico SDK should be
   fetched as part of the operation (`PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT`). 

```shell
$ PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT=on cmake ..

4. Build the firmware.

```shell
$ make

[ 30%] Linking CXX executable picoprobe.elf
[100%] Built target picoprobe
```

After the build is complete, we should see a number of artifacts in the `build`
directory.

```shell
$ ls
CMakeCache.txt  cmake_install.cmake  elf2uf2          generated  picoprobe.bin  picoprobe.elf      picoprobe.hex  pico-sdk  probe_oen.pio.h
CMakeFiles      _deps                FREERTOS_KERNEL  Makefile   picoprobe.dis  picoprobe.elf.map  picoprobe.uf2  pioasm    probe.pio.h
```

## Programming the Pico

There are multiple ways to program the Pico, but the simplest is by holding down
the boot select (`BOOTSEL`) button while you connect it to your development
machine. This will cause the Pico to appear as a [USB Mass Storage
Device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_mass_storage_device_class), meaning
you can access it from your machine's filesystem.

```shell
$ ls /media/hasheddan/RPI-RP2/
INDEX.HTM  INFO_UF2.TXT
```

Copying the `picoprobe.uf2` file into the mounted directory will cause the
RP2040 to reboot and start running the firmware.

```
$ cp picoprobe.uf2 /media/hasheddan/RPI-RP2/
```

The Pico should now show up as a USB serial device.

```shell
$ ls /dev/ | grep "ACM\|USB"
ttyACM0
```

We can use `minicom` to monitor the serial output. Initially we shouldn't see
any output as `picoprobe` is configured to direct its debug information to
`UART0` by default. The output we eventually see over USB serial will be the
bridged output from the Pinecil microcontroller.

```shell
$ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 2000000
```

## Building the Pinecil Firmware

The Pinecil v2 runs on the [Bouffalo Lab
BL706](https://en.bouffalolab.com/product/?type=detail&id=8) chipset, which
includes a [32-bit RISC-V processor](https://riscv.org/) based on the [SiFive
E24
core](https://sifive-china.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/Standard%20Core%20IP/e24_core_complex_manual_21G2.pdf).
It is supported by the open source [IronOS](https://github.com/Ralim/IronOS)
project, which was originally developed as alternative firmware for the
[TS100](https://www.ifixit.com/products/ts100-soldering-iron) iron. IronOS is
the default firmware on the Pinecil. 

IronOS is also built on FreeRTOS, and leverages the `bl_mcu_sdk`, which has
evolved into [the `bouffalo_sdk`](https://github.com/bouffalolab/bouffalo_sdk).
According to the
[datasheet](http://download.bl602.fun/BL702_%E5%AE%98%E6%96%B9%E8%8A%AF%E7%89%87%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8C.pdf),
the BL706 has two built-in UARTs, and IronOS
[configures](https://github.com/Ralim/IronOS/blob/6e2bca9699347d9d1381087149ab70ca0f6fcb4c/source/Core/BSP/Pinecilv2/peripheral_config.h#L82)
`UART0` to run at `2000000` baud, which is why we supplied the `-b 2000000` to
`minicom` above.

```c
#if defined(BSP_USING_UART0)
#ifndef UART0_CONFIG
#define UART0_CONFIG \
  { .id = 0, .baudrate = 2000000, .databits = UART_DATA_LEN_8, .stopbits = UART_STOP_ONE, .parity = UART_PAR_NONE, .fifo_threshold = 0, }
#endif
#endif
```

IronOS has an excellent [Docker-based build
flow](https://github.com/Ralim/IronOS/blob/6e2bca9699347d9d1381087149ab70ca0f6fcb4c/Documentation/Development.md#building-pinecil-v20),
which alleviates the need to install your own RISC-V toolchain. The following
steps can be used to build an English binary for the Pinecil v2.

1. Start the build container.

```shell
$ ./scripts/deploy.sh 

====>>>> Firing up & starting container...
	* type "./scripts/deploy.sh clean" to delete created container (but not cached data)

====>>>> /usr/bin/docker  compose  -f /home/hasheddan/code/github.com/Ralim/IronOS/./scripts/../Env.yml  run  --rm  builder

/build/ironos #
```

2. Run build script.

```shell
/build/ironos # cd source/ && ./build.sh -l EN -m Pinecilv2

```

After the build completes, you can type `exit` to exit the container. Build
artifacts should be present in `source/Hexfile/`.

```shell
$ ls source/Hexfile/
Pinecilv2_EN.bin  Pinecilv2_EN.dfu  Pinecilv2_EN.elf  Pinecilv2_EN.elf.map  Pinecilv2_EN.hex
```

## Programming the Pinecil

The Pinecil can be programmed, including when connecting via the breakout board,
by holding down the button labeled `-` while plugging the USB cable into your
development machine. Pine64 offers an [in-system programming
(ISP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-system_programming) tool for its
Bouffalo Lab devices, appropriately named `blisp`, which can be downloaded from
the project's [releases page](https://github.com/pine64/blisp/releases).

After installing, the following command can be used to flash the IronOS firmware
onto the device.

```shell
$ sudo ./blisp write -c bl70x --reset Pinecilv2_EN.bin

```

## Connecting the Pinecil to the Pico

The last step to see the serial output emitted by the IronOS firmware running on
the Pinecil is to connect the UART pins on the breakout board to the Pico
running `picoprobe`. `UART1` on the Pico is used for the USB-UART bridge, and
pins 6 and 7 correspond to `UART1 TX` and `UART1 RX` respectively. The `RX` pin
on the Pinecil breakout UART header should be connected to pin 6 on the Pico,
while `TX` should be connected to pin 7. Lastly, the UART `GND` (ground) pin on
the breakout board should be connected to a `GND` pin, such as pin 3, on the
Pico. The full mapping is provided below.

| **Pinecil Breakout** | **Pico**         |
|----------------------|------------------|
| UART RX              | Pin 6 (UART1 TX) |
| UART TX              | Pin 7 (UART1 RX) |
| UART GND             | Pin 3 (GND)      |

{{< center-img src="../../static/risc_v_pinecil_uart_picoprobe_0.jpg"
alt="risc-v-pinecil-uart-picoprobe-0" >}}

With the wiring in place, the Pico connected to your development machine, and
`minicom` running, we can connect the Pinecil to a power source via the breakout
board. We should see the following output in our `minicom` session with the
Pico.

```

This information is emitted by [invoking

on startup. With the ability to build, program, and monitor the firmware, we can
start to make changes and test them out on the Pinecil hardware. In our next
post, we'll begin walking through exactly what the Bouffalo Lab SDK and IronOS
are doing, then see how we can modify them to include new functionality.
