I frequently work with ESP32 [microcontrollers
(MCU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller), both at my day job and in
my free time. These devices are very flexible, but like any microcontroller they
are quite resource constrained in comparison to anything equivalent to or larger
than a single-board computer.

There are a few different variants of the ESP32 these days, but one of the newer
and most popular is the
[ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3). Compared to the
[ESP32-S2](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2), it offers a
dual-core 32-bit Xtensa processor, support for Bluetooth 5.0, and more on-chip
SRAM and ROM (full comparison can be found
[here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.0/esp32s3/hw-reference/chip-series-comparison.html)).
Both of these SoC's, as well as others from Espressif, allow for integrating
external RAM and flash, making it possible to run larger, more complex firmware.

At first thought, it may seem as though it would be desirable for
microcontrollers to use [dynamic random access memory
(DRAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory) as it is
more dense than [static random access memory
(SRAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory), and thus
cheaper. However, as the name suggests, DRAM must be constantly refreshed, which
leads to higher power consumption when idle. The refresh behavior of DRAM also
makes it more complex to integrate into a system. Given that microcontrollers
typically only require a small amount of RAM, SRAM is generally used for on-chip
memory.

The ESP32-S3 has 512 KB of on-chip SRAM, but is capable of mapping up to 32 MB
of [external
RAM](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-guides/external-ram.html)
into its memory address space. In order to make this larger external RAM exhibit
similar properties to the on-chip RAM, [pseudostatic RAM
(PSRAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory#PSRAM) is
used. PSRAM is technically DRAM, but the external chip contains its own refresh
circuitry, allowing it to appear to the MCU like SRAM that is communicated with
via a [serial peripheral interface
(SPI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) bus.

[`esp-idf`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) provides a few different
mechanisms for dynamically allocating in external RAM, which are enabled via the
`CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE` options.

- `CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE_MEMMAP`: maps external RAM into the virtual address space,
  but leaves all access and management to the programmer.
- `CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE_CAPS_ALLOC`: maps external RAM into the virtual address
  space, and makes it accessible to the [capability-based heap memory
  allocator](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-reference/system/mem_alloc.html#memory-capabilities).
  This allows the programmer to utilize the memory by specifying
  `MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM` explicitly with `heap_caps_malloc()`.
- `CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE_MALLOC`: does the same as `CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE_CAPS_ALLOC`,
  but also allows for a standard `malloc()` call to allocate in external RAM.

I was recently working on a project where I wanted to use a buffer that exceeded
the size of the on-chip RAM. The buffer would be reused and would be needed
throughout the duration of execution. I started out with using the capability
allocator with `MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM` to dynamically allocate the memory for the
buffer early in the program's execution. The following is a toy program
demonstrating the functionality.

```c
#include "esp_heap_caps.h"
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

static uint8_t *buf = NULL;

void app_main(void) {
  printf("Let's allocate some external memory!\n");
  buf = heap_caps_malloc(1000000, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM);
  assert(buf);
  printf("Address: %p\n", (void *)buf);
}
```

Attempting to allocate the 1 MB buffer in on-chip memory would fail as it alone
exceeds the 512 KB capacity. Specifying that external memory should be used
results in successful allocation. Flashing and running this program results in
the following output.

```
I (1204) main_task: Started on CPU0
I (1214) main_task: Calling app_main()
Let's allocate some external memory!
Address: 0x3c030b4c
I (1214) main_task: Returned from app_main()
```

If we look at the sections of the ELF file from our build, we can see that the
virtual address of the allocated memory (`0x3c030b4c`) is slightly offset from
the `.ext_ram.bss` section address, which currently has a size of zero.

The starting virtual address was assigned by the [memory management unit
(MMU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit) on PSRAM
initialization by identifying the largest block of free virtual address space,
then reserving a block with size equivalent to the minimum of the largest block
size and the available PSRAM capacity.

This block is subsequently added to the heap allocator when

```

We can see this in action by observing the logs that preceded our entry to the
`main_task`.

```
I (1174) esp_psram: Adding pool of 8192K of PSRAM memory to heap allocator
```

However, in this use-case the buffer only needs to be initialized to zero and we
aren't going to reclaim the memory. Ideally we could avoid the need to
dynamically allocate at all, and instead specify the size of the buffer that we
need at compile time. Fortunately, `esp-idf` allows for use of the
`EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR` macro when `CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_BSS_SEG_EXTERNAL_MEMORY=y`.
`EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR` expands to `__attribute__((section(".ext_ram.bss")))`, which
indicates that a variable should be placed in the `.bss` (zero-initialized
memory) section of the `.ext_ram` (external RAM).

```c
#include "esp_heap_caps.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

static EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR uint8_t buf[1000000];

void app_main(void) {
  printf("Let's allocate some external memory!\n");
  printf("Address: %p\n", (void *)&buf);
}
```

Building and running now yields the following output.

```
I (1275) main_task: Started on CPU0
I (1285) main_task: Calling app_main()
Let's allocate some external memory!
Address: 0x3c030000
I (1285) main_task: Returned from app_main()
```

If we take a look at the ELF section headers, we'll see that the `.ext_ram.bss`
no longer has a size of zero, and the address matches that of the statically
allocated buffer (`0x3c030000`). The size (`0x0f4240`) matches that of our
`1000000` byte buffer.

While statically allocating is not always the right option, using the technique
described in this post to target external memory allows for larger static
allocation than would be possible if only targeting on-chip RAM.
