In [a recent post](https://danielmangum.com/posts/when-vivado-infer-bram/) we
explored when [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html)
inferred Block RAM (BRAM) for memories in FPGA designs, and when it used
distributed RAM instead. While it is somewhat obvious why BRAM can be used for
memory in an FPGA (i.e. it is literally a discrete memory element), distributed
RAM is a bit more complicated.

Look-Up Tables (LUTs) are a key element of FPGAs that allow it to behave as
"reconfigurable hardware". Depending on the the size (number of inputs and
outputs) of a LUT, some set of logic functions can be programmed as part of a
design. Understanding how this is possible requires exploring the architecture
of LUT elements. We have been using [Xilinx 7 Series
FPGAs](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/artix-7.html) while
developing [`moss`](https://github.com/mosscomp/moss), so we'll focus on them
today. The Xilinx design elements documentation decsribes LUTs as follows.

[_Xilinx Design Elements Documentation_](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug953-vivado-7series-libraries/Design-Elements)

Internally, LUTs are typically implemented with [static random access memory
(SRAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory) and
[multiplexers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer). The SRAM bits are
written on FPGA configuration to dictate the outputs when various inputs are
supplied. SRAM is the same technology used to implement CPU registers and
caches, and is typically faster than [dynamic random access memory
(DRAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory), which has
to be periodically refreshed to retain its contents. [All About
Circuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com) has a [great
post](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/purpose-and-internal-functionality-of-fpga-look-up-tables/)
on internal architecture of LUTs if you are interested in learning more.

LUTs can vary in their number of inputs. For example, the diagram below
illustrates a 2-input LUT (`LUT2`).

{{< center-img src="../../static/moss_lut_storage_0.png" alt="moss-lut-storage-0" >}}

> Abstract depiction of a 2-input LUT.

The `INIT[X]` values refer to those programmed via the FPGA bitstream, while the
`I0` and `I1` signals represent wires that are dynamically driven high or low.
Those input signals can be thought of as the "selectors" for the multiplexer,
with each permutation selecting a different initial value. Therefore, if we have
4 initial values, we will need 2 input signals to be able to select each of them
(i.e `# initial values = 2^(# input signals)`).

The ability to set each of the `INIT[X]` values to `1` or `0` means that we can
implement any [truth table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table). In other
words, we can implement arbitrary logic. The truth table for the `LUT2` example
above looks as follows.

| I0 | I1 | O       |
|----|----|---------|
| `0`  | `0`  | `INIT[0]` |
| `0`  | `1`  | `INIT[1]` |
| `1`  | `0`  | `INIT[2]` |
| `1`  | `1`  | `INIT[3]` |

Looking back at our example from last post where distributed RAM was used to
implement our design, we can see
[`RAM32M`](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug953-vivado-7series-libraries/RAM32M)
and
[`RAM32X1D`](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug953-vivado-7series-libraries/RAM32X1D)
elements.

The `RAM32M` element is described as follows in the Xilinx docs:

> This design element is a 32-bit deep by 8-bit wide, multi-port, random access
> memory with synchronous write and asynchronous independent, 2-bit, wide-read
> capability. This RAM is implemented using the LUT resources of the device
> known as SelectRAMâ„¢+, and does not consume any of the Block RAM resources of
> the device.

[_`RAM32M` Element Documentation_](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug953-vivado-7series-libraries/RAM32M)

Expanding the element reveals the underlying LUT primitives.

However, rather than being labeled as LUT elements, they are named `RAMD32`. On
Xilinx 7 Series FPGAs, LUTs reside in either a `SLICEL` or `SLICEM`, with the
`L` suffix denoting "logic" and the `M` denoting "memory". Each slice has 4
6-input LUT elements (i.e. `LUT6`). In `SLICEM` slices, the LUTs can be
configured as distributed memory. `RAM32M` elements use all 4 LUTs on a `SLICEM`
slice.

> By our earlier calculation, a `LUT6` element has `2^6 = 64` initial values.

As can be seen in the schematic, the LUTs support 5 read address ports (`RADR`)
and 5 write address (`WADR`). Though `SLICEM` slices contain 6-input LUTs, [a
`LUT6` is just two `LUT5` elements wired
together](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug953-vivado-7series-libraries/LUT6_2),
so a single `RAMD32` refers to a `LUT5` configured as distributed RAM. We see 8
`LUT5` elements making up a `RAM32M` distributed memory (4 `LUT6` elements, each
comprised of 2 `LUT5` elements).

If we look at the same elements on the device, we can see the `LUT5` within the
`LUT6`.

Zooming out further, we can see the 4 `LUT6` elements in both `SLICEM` and
`SLICEL` slices.

However, the `SLICEM` LUTs, as previously mentioned, also support writing, which
is why we see the additional `WADR` address lines, as well as a write enable
(`WE`) and write clock (`WCLK`) signal. The comparison between BRAM and
distributed RAM in our earlier post identified that, with BRAM, read and writes
are both synchronous, whereas with distributed RAM writes are synchronous, but
reads are asynchronous. In order to implement the synchronous writes, a clock
signal (`WCLK`) is required.

Though it may be obvious at this point, the reason _why_ these LUTs can be used
as distributed RAM is because **we already need to be able to write values to
LUT SRAM to configure the FPGA**. When they are used as distributed RAM, we use
that same functionality to write values _after_ configuration. The
aforementioned "initial values" (i.e. `INIT[X]`) are not only available for
reading, but also for writing.

## Closing Thoughts

Small realizations about the physical characteristics of a device can help us
develop a better intuition about why designs are being implemented in a certain
manner, as well as the tradeoffs of using different types of components. These
are the tedious details that I hope to continue to capture via
[livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/@hasheddan/streams) and posts in [this

expertise in chip
design](https://danielmangum.com/posts/a-three-year-bet-on-chip-design/) and
