I have recently been working with the
[RAKwireless](https://www.rakwireless.com/) [RAK5010 development
board](https://www.rakwireless.com/en-us/products/nb-iot-boards/rak5010-nb-iot-tracker).
It includes the popular Nordic
[nRF52840](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF52840) MCU for running
applications on its [Cortex-M4](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Cortex-M4)
CPU that can leverage the integrated 2.4 GHz multiprotocol support, as well as
the LTE and GNSS support offered by the on-board [Quectel
BG95-M3](https://www.quectel.com/product/lpwa-bg95-cat-m1-cat-nb2-egprs-series/)
module.

The [micro-USB
port](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wistrio/rak5010-m/datasheet/#micro-b-usb-interface)
on the board is connected to USB on the nRF52840, which allows for viewing
serial output, but is not a mechanism for flashing new firmware. My coworker
[Mike Szczys](https://bsky.app/profile/szczys.bsky.social) wrote about how to
program the RAK5010's nRF52840 using a [Segger J-Link debug
probe](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/) over on the
[Golioth
blog](https://blog.golioth.io/how-to-use-the-rak5010-cellular-dev-board-with-zephyr/).
However, I wanted to access the BG95-M3 module's USB peripheral, which provides
access to three serial ports on the underlying [Qualcomm
9205](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/technology/modems/qualcomm-9205-lte-modem)
LTE modem.

The RAK5010
[documentation](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wistrio/rak5010-m/datasheet/#micro-b-usb-interface)
states the following with respect to the micro-USB port:

>  It also can connect to BG95-M3 by reworking some resistors on the board. If

They conveniently omit the specific resistors that need to be reworked so it was
time to break out the
[schematic](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wistrio/rak5010-m/datasheet/schematic-diagram-part-1.png).
Fortunately, it didn't take long to find the 4 resistors on the USB data lines
(`D+` / `D-`) that corresponded to the USB connections on the nRF52840 and the
BG95-M3. As expected, `R32` and `R33` were marked as `0` ("zero ohm resistors")
and connected the USB data lines to the nRF52840, whereas `R30` and `R31` were
marked `NC` ("not connected") and connected to the BG95-M3.

I set up the RAK5010 on my
[PCBite](https://sensepeek.com/pcbite-kit-large-base-plate) and was able to
verify this placement with some magnification.

Now it was time to get to work. Ideally I would have a hot air station or
tweezer tips for one of my irons to desolder these tiny resistors, but all I had
on hand was my [Weller WE1010NA
station](https://www.weller-tools.com/us/en/industrial-soldering/products/soldering-stations/we1010na)
and my USB-C powered
[Pinecil](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/)
(the latter of which I have
[written](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-soldering-pinecil-breakout-board/)
about
[before](https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-accessing-pinecil-uart-picoprobe/)).
With minimal damage to the board, I was able to deploy the "chopsticks" approach
to remove the two zero ohm resistors.

Now it was time to move them to the `R30` and `R31` pads. This was simpler as I
could hold a single resistor in place, soldering one side then the other. The
first application went smoothly, but did I mention how small these are? While
handling the second resistor with tweezers, it sprang out of my grasp and found
a new home for itself somewhere in the carpet of my home office. Fortunately a
zero ohm resistor can easily be replaced with a bodge wire or a simple solder
bridge. I went with the latter, creating an unsightly, yet effective connection
on the `R30` pads.

With the connections in place, it was time to reconnect the board the my laptop
and hope that three serial ports appeared instead of the one when connected to
the nRF52840.

```
$ ls -1 /dev/serial/by-id
usb-Quectel__Incorporated_Quectel_LPWA_Module_e3e6f540-if00-port0
usb-Quectel__Incorporated_Quectel_LPWA_Module_e3e6f540-if01-port0
usb-Quectel__Incorporated_Quectel_LPWA_Module_e3e6f540-if02-port0
```

So far so good. The third serial port should be the AT command port. I verified
by reading from it and printing to standard output.

```
$ cat /dev/ttyUSB2

RDY



+CFUN: 1



+QSIMSTAT: 1,0



+CPIN: NOT INSERTED

AT
OK

APP RDY
AT
OK
```

Success! With just this little bit of rework, I was able to communicate directly
with the modem from my local machine over USB. From there, I was off to the
races.
