In my [last post](https://danielmangum.com/posts/usb-uart-thingy91-x/) on the
[Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com/) [Thingy:91
X](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-91-X)
IoT prototyping platform, I outlined the features and architecture of the
device. The combination of wireless protocols on the Thingy:91 X (Bluetooth LE,
LTE-M, Wi-Fi) make it a compelling foundation for a wide variety of
applications. However, there are a few intricacies to the protocol support.

Namely, the primary stated purpose of the Wi-Fi support is for [network-based
positioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system) (i.e. scan
for local access points, send them to a server, get approximate location back).
This leverages the nRF7002's radio, but uses it in [scan
mode](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-2.9.0/page/nrf/protocols/wifi/scan_mode/index.html),
consuming less resources on the host MCU. This is important, particularly if the
nRF9151 is acting as the host MCU rather than the nRF5340, as the former has
constrained RAM (256 KB) and does not support [external execute-in-place
(XIP)](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-2.9.0/page/nrf/app_dev/device_guides/nrf53/qspi_xip_guide_nrf5340.html).
External XIP allows a device to relocate some of its application code to an
external flash memory component, then include the external flash in its memory
map in order to execute the relocated code. The nRF5340 supports external XIP,
allowing it to accommodate applications with larger code size despite having the
same amount of internal flash memory (1 MB) as the nRF9151. It also has 512 KB
of RAM compared to the nRF9151's 256 KB.

There are two aspects of Wi-Fi support on the nRF70 series companion ICs that
impact resource consumption on the host MCU: patches and the driver. The
firmware patches are loaded onto the nRF70 device by the host MCU and add
functionality to the base ROM. They are included in the host MCUs firmware by
default as part of the Wi-Fi driver it leverages to communicate with the nRF70
device. This increases the code size, which, as previously mentioned, can be
partially mitigated if [the host supports external
XIP](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/app_dev/device_guides/nrf70/fw_patches_ext_flash.html#using_xip_access)
(`SB_CONFIG_WIFI_PATCHES_EXT_FLASH_XIP`). The nRF70 series also supports
[loading patches from non-XIP QSPI
flash](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/app_dev/device_guides/nrf70/fw_patches_ext_flash.html#using_qspi_transfers_to_ram)
(`SB_CONFIG_WIFI_PATCHES_EXT_FLASH_STORE`). In this case the Wi-Fi driver on the
host loads the patch into RAM, then transfers it to the nRF70 device. As one
might expect, the
[patch](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrfxlib/blob/6f23a22baf67819f3baac99f5004e766cfb7c6d9/nrf_wifi/bin/ncs/scan_only/nrf70.bin)
that only enables scan mode is significantly smaller (32 KB) than the
[patch](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrfxlib/blob/6f23a22baf67819f3baac99f5004e766cfb7c6d9/nrf_wifi/bin/ncs/default/nrf70.bin)
that enables full functionality (77.8 KB).

The second, and potentially more impactful, contributor to resource consumption
on the host MCU is the flash and RAM consumption of the driver itself.
Specifically, to use an nRF70 device in [station
mode](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-2.9.0/page/nrf/protocols/wifi/station_mode/index.html),
[WPA supplicant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wpa_supplicant) is required,
which can add anywhere from 180 KB to 250 KB to code size (flash). The total
driver RAM consumption also increases from around 30 KB to around 130 KB.
Attempting to fit anything of consequence alongside it into 256 KB of RAM on the
nRF9151 would be challenging, which is likely why the current documentation does
not indicate station mode support for nRF91 series devices (all of which have
256 KB of RAM).

However, from a raw resource perspective, the simplest station mode application
_should_ be able to run on the nRF9151. I noticed that the
[example](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/69c67d2f7f6fbcd52eb3e432115772571109ca3b/samples/wifi/sta)
included support for the [nRF52840
DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52840-DK) (with
the [nRF7002 EK
shield](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF7002-ek)),
and the [nRF52840 SoC](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF52840) matches the
nRF9151 in RAM (256 KB) and flash size (1 MB). Surely we could get it working on
the nRF9151 as well.

To enable Wi-Fi on the nRF9151, an overlay file that includes the
`thingy91x_wifi.dtsi` devictree file is necessary.

`thingy91x_nrf9151_ns.overlay`

```
#include <thingy91x_wifi.dtsi>
```

This serves to enable the nRF7002 and its dedicated power management IC (PMIC)
([nPM6001](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nPM6001)), as well as the short
range (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) capabilities of the RF front end.

`thingy91x_wifi.dtsi`

```

&nrf70 {

};
```

If we look at the schematic, both the Wi-Fi PMIC (`ldsw_nPM6001_en`) and the RF
front end (`ldsw_rf_fe_sr_en`) enable signals are connected to the main PMIC
([nPM1300](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nPM1300)).

{{< center-img src="../../static/nrf9151_wifi_host_0.png"
alt="nrf9151-wifi-host-0" >}}

`ldsw_nPM6001_en` is enabled via the `regulator-boot-on` label in the included
devicetree file, which will cause it to be turned on when the nPM1300 driver is
initialized.

The RF frontend is not enabled until later alongside the nPM6001 regulators.
When `CONFIG_WIFI_NRF70=y`, the [`nrf70_support.c`
"library"](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/blob/62256979f5f5dde7567b7fcff91b77c40684e3b2/boards/nordic/thingy91x/nrf70_support.c)
is included in the build via the Thingy:91 X [board
`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/blob/62256979f5f5dde7567b7fcff91b77c40684e3b2/boards/nordic/thingy91x/CMakeLists.txt).

  endif()
endif()
```

When the Wi-Fi interface is brought up, the `nrf_wifi_if_zep_start_board`
function is invoked.

`nrf70_support.c`
```c
static const struct device *wifi_regulator = DEVICE_DT_GET(DT_NODELABEL(reg_wifi));

static const struct gpio_dt_spec ldsw_rf_fe_sr_en = {
	.port = DEVICE_DT_GET(DT_PARENT(DT_NODELABEL(ldsw_rf_fe_sr_en))),
	.pin = 1,
	.dt_flags = GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW | GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN | GPIO_PULL_UP,
};

/* Enable the regulator and set the GPIO pin to enable the RF frontend */
int nrf_wifi_if_zep_start_board(const struct device *dev)
{
	ARG_UNUSED(dev);
	int ret;

	ret = regulator_enable(wifi_regulator);
	if (ret) {
		LOG_ERR("Cannot turn on regulator %s (%d)", wifi_regulator->name, ret);
		return ret;
	}
	ret = regulator_set_mode(wifi_regulator, NPM6001_MODE_PWM);
	if (ret) {
		LOG_ERR("Cannot set mode for regulator %s (%d)", wifi_regulator->name, ret);
		return ret;
	}

	ret = gpio_pin_set_dt(&ldsw_rf_fe_sr_en, 1);
	if (ret) {
		LOG_ERR("Cannot set GPIO %s (%d)", ldsw_rf_fe_sr_en.port->name, ret);
		return ret;
	}

	/* Wait for the load switch to settle on operating voltage. */
	k_sleep(K_USEC(300));

	return 0;
}
```

The `regulator_enable` and `regulator_set_mode` calls utilitze the nPM6001
driver to configure the `reg_wifi` regulator via the I2C connection to the
nPM6001. Then the RF front end short range capabilities are enabled via the
`gpio_pin_set_dt` call. Because the `port` of `ldsw_rf_fe_sr_en` is set to the
parent of the devicetree node label, the GPIO is pulled high by talking to the
nPM1300 over I2C. The generated devicetree file makes these relationships plain.

Because this setup is just enabling the hardware necessary to use Wi-Fi
capabilities, it is the same whether using the nRF7002 in scan or station mode.
Kconfig is used to determine the firmware support, including what patch is
included and loaded. By default, `CONFIG_NRF70_SYSTEM_MODE=y` is selected when
using the nRF7002, which results in the `default` patch being included via the
[nrf_wifi](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-zephyr/blob/b83eabe0b2cb9b461a6c2e43ce8fc91f5fe4f1fa/drivers/wifi/nrf_wifi/CMakeLists.txt)

The station example provides the configuration for this setup in [the
`prj.conf`](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/blob/91ce90f992570664ed50ebbcfd23d3cf496a6d3a/samples/wifi/sta/prj.conf).
The application can be built for the nRF9151 on the Thingy:91 X with the
following command.

```
west build -p -b thingy91x/nrf9151/ns .
```

"Barely" in the title of this post might be an understatement. The build is
successful, but utilies `99.11%` of available RAM.

```

I had set my Wi-Fi SSID (`CONFIG_WIFI_CREDENTIALS_STATIC_SSID`) and password
(`CONFIG_WIFI_CREDENTIALS_STATIC_PASSWORD`) in the `prj.conf`, but on my first
attempt of programming the Thingy:91 X with `west flash --recover`, I observed
the following output.

```

The error was orginating from the following line in the application.

`main.c`
```c
	if (net_mgmt(NET_REQUEST_WIFI_CONNECT_STORED, iface, NULL, 0)) {
		LOG_ERR("Connection request failed");

		return -ENOEXEC;
	}
```

The log line from `wifi_mgmt_ext` provided a hint that this [network
management](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/connectivity/networking/api/net_mgmt.html)
command was being handled by Nordic's [extended Wi-Fi command
library](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/blob/f8857a6c6c1d30fc1c599fca63528068aeb97ca9/subsys/net/lib/wifi_mgmt_ext/wifi_mgmt_ext.c#L318).

`wifi_mgmt_ext.c`
```c
static int wifi_ext_command(uint32_t mgmt_request, struct net_if *iface, void *data, size_t len)
{
	int ret = 0;

	ret = add_static_network_config(iface);
	if (ret) {
		return ret;
	}

	wifi_credentials_for_each_ssid(add_stored_network, iface);

	return ret;
};

NET_MGMT_REGISTER_REQUEST_HANDLER(NET_REQUEST_WIFI_CONNECT_STORED, wifi_ext_command);
```

To quickly diagnose the problem, I used `west attach` to connect with GDB and
step through the call stack. I started by setting a breakpoint on
`wifi_ext_command` and resetting the target.

```
(gdb) b wifi_ext_command
Breakpoint 1 at 0x6c8e0
(gdb) monitor reset
Resetting target
```

Shortly after boot, the application hit the breakpoint.

```
Breakpoint 1, wifi_ext_command (mgmt_request=mgmt_request@entry=1364590702, iface=0x2000f5a0 <__net_if_dts_ord_126_0>, data=data@entry=0x0, len=len@entry=0)
```

The `iface` being passed matches the devicetree number of the `wlan0` interface
accessed via SPI on the nRF7002.

```
 *   126 /soc/peripheral@40000000/spi@b000/wifi@1/wlan0
```

Stepping through `add_static_network_config`, it returns with a [call to
`add_network_from_credentials_struct_personal`](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/blob/f8857a6c6c1d30fc1c599fca63528068aeb97ca9/subsys/net/lib/wifi_mgmt_ext/wifi_mgmt_ext.c#L215),
which invokes the `NET_REQUEST_WIFI_CONNECT` command.

The `connect` callback should be provided by the ["glue
code"](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/1280f432f4aa5e423ba5ef89038efbecfd9cd222/modules/hostap/src/supp_main.c#L55)
that ties `wpa_supplicant` into Zephyr's networking stack.

`supp_main.c`
```c
static const struct wifi_mgmt_ops mgmt_ops = {
	.get_version = supplicant_get_version,
	.scan = supplicant_scan,
	.connect = supplicant_connect,
	.disconnect = supplicant_disconnect,
...
```

The `wpa_supplicant` error log was a good hint as to why that may not be
happening.

```
[00:00:01.620,666] <err> wifi_supplicant: Failed to add iface wlan0
```

The log [originates in the
`wpa_supplicant_add_iface`](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/hostap/blob/6855231ec7ecc13de2c8c756d35a9a5da45f9f26/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.c#L7570)
function when attempting to initialize the interface.

`wpa_supplicant.c`
```c
	if (wpa_supplicant_init_iface(wpa_s, &t_iface)) {
		wpa_printf(MSG_DEBUG, "Failed to add interface %s",
			   iface->ifname);
		wpa_supplicant_deinit_iface(wpa_s, 0, 0);
		return NULL;
	}
```

I went further down the rabbit hole of the steps required for initialization
than I have space to enumerate here, but the issue became obvious after setting
a breakpoint and stepping through the call stack.

```
(gdb) where

```

`l2_packet_init` is where we [return back to Zephyr
land](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/hostap/blob/6855231ec7ecc13de2c8c756d35a9a5da45f9f26/src/l2_packet/l2_packet_zephyr.c#L146),
[eventually
attempting](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/hostap/blob/6855231ec7ecc13de2c8c756d35a9a5da45f9f26/src/l2_packet/l2_packet_zephyr.c#L146)
to create a `socket`.

`l2_packet_zephyr.c`
```c
	l2->fd = socket(AF_PACKET, l2_hdr ? SOCK_RAW : SOCK_DGRAM,
			htons(protocol));
	if (l2->fd < 0) {
		wpa_printf(MSG_ERROR,
			   "Failed to open socket: %s, proto: %d, af: %d",
			   strerror(errno), htons(protocol), AF_PACKET);
		goto fail;
	}
```

Stepping through the socket call, we can see that the creation handler is being
provided by the `nrf_modem_lib`. In other words, we are attempting to create an
offloaded socket on the nRF9151 modem, then use it for Wi-Fi via the nRF7002.

```
Breakpoint 10, socket (family=3, type=2, proto=36488)
394		return zsock_socket(family, type, proto);
(gdb) s
zsock_socket (proto=36488, type=2, family=3)
60		return z_impl_zsock_socket(family, type, proto);
(gdb) s
z_impl_zsock_socket (family=3, type=2, proto=36488)
109		STRUCT_SECTION_FOREACH(net_socket_register, sock_family) {

112			if (sock_family->family != family &&
(gdb) 
119			if (!sock_family->is_supported(family, type, proto)) {
(gdb) 
nrf9x_socket_is_supported (family=3, type=2, proto=36488)
1045		if (offload_disabled) {
...
0x00057afe in z_impl_zsock_socket (family=3, type=2, proto=36488)
123			errno = 0;
(gdb) s
124			ret = sock_family->handler(family, type, proto);
(gdb) 
nrf9x_socket_create (family=3, type=2, proto=36488)
1079		if (type & SOCK_NATIVE) {
(gdb) s
1090		sd = nrf9x_socket_offload_socket(family, type, proto);
(gdb) s
nrf9x_socket_offload_socket (proto=36488, type=2, family=3)
336		retval = nrf_socket(family, type, proto);
(gdb) s
nrf9x_socket_create (proto=36488, type=2, family=3)
1091		if (sd < 0) {
nrf9x_socket_create (proto=36488, type=<optimized out>, family=3)
1093			return -1;
```

The small fix here is to disable the `nrf_modem_lib`, which is enabled by
default on the nRF9151. This can be accomplished by adding a board-specific
`.conf` file for the Thingy:91 X.

`thingy91x_nrf9151_ns.conf`
```
CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB=n
```

Building and flashing again results in the expected output, and successful
connection to the local Wi-Fi network.

We also free up some RAM, though we're stll operating on the margin.

Stepping through again, we can now see that the `socket` implementation is
[provided
by](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/1280f432f4aa5e423ba5ef89038efbecfd9cd222/subsys/net/lib/sockets/sockets_packet.c#L43)
`zpacket_socket`.

```
0x00057bfe in z_impl_zsock_socket (family=3, type=2, proto=36488)
123			errno = 0;
(gdb) s
124			ret = sock_family->handler(family, type, proto);
(gdb) s
zpacket_socket (family=3, type=2, proto=36488)
49		fd = zvfs_reserve_fd();
```

There is still more to explore to determine the capabilities and limitations of
using a resource constrained MCU host with nRF70 series devices, but knowing
that it is possible opens up the door for some interesting multi-protocol
designs. If interested in trying it out for yourself, I [opened a
PR](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/pull/20303) to the nRF Connect SDK add
ing support for using the nRF9151 on the Thingy:91 X as Wi-Fi host.
