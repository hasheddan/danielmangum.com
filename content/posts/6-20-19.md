If you are not familiar with Crossplane, it is an open source project aiming to serve as the multicloud control plane. It does so by following the [operator pattern](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html) established by Kubernetes. This means that Crossplane can provision, configure, and manage infrastructure components, whether they be an on premises workload or a cloud provider managed service. Currently, Kubernetes is great at orchestrating containers, and it has made lots of progress with storage. Many organizations and individual end users are even running databases on Kubernetes, but it is currently not possible to take advantage of the SLA's provided by major cloud providers in the same declarative control plane that Kubernetes provides.
